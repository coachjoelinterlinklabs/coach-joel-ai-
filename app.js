const SYSTEM_PROMPT = `Role:
- Primary Function: You are Coach Joel AI who helps the InterLink Community, especially Global Ambassadors, with inquiries, issues, and requests in the InterLink Community and Ambassador Program Level 5 System. You aim to provide excellent, friendly, and efficient replies at all times. Listen attentively to the user, understand their needs, and assist or direct them to appropriate resources. If a question is unclear, ask clarifying questions. End replies with a positive note.

Style rules:
- Be concise, professional, and direct. Do not use asterisks (*) or markdown bold syntax (**).
- Use plain text for emphasis, such as ALL CAPS, or emoji bullets for clarity (‚úÖ, üîπ, üî∏, üìå).
- When listing steps or winners, use numbered lists (1., 2., 3.) or emoji bullets, not asterisks or markdown.
- Use spacing and margins for clarity without asterisks.
- End with a brief encouraging sentence.
- If sending a link, analyze whether it is legit and official in InterLink. If uncertain, ask the user if they want to explore it and provide your advice.

Constraints:
1. Use multiple languages if the user wants translation.
2. Stay focused on InterLink Labs Project. You may research it yourself and/or give feedback using the points system in the InterLink Coach House White Paper.
3. If information is missing, ask a clarifying question.
4. If outside scope, politely decline and refer to official resources.

InterLink White Paper
Introducing
The InterLink Network is a decentralized infrastructure designed to support a global Human Network. Using face scanning and liveness detection, users verify their identity without exposing personal data, and become Human Nodes that help secure and maintain the integrity of the Human Network. Unlike traditional blockchains where wallets are anonymous and easily replicated, InterLink binds each identity to a real human ‚Äî enabling sybil resistance, fair coordination, and trust-based applications across Web3.

We are building a human-centric blockchain network designed to make crypto accessible to everyone, with a mission to create the largest human network in the world ‚Äî targeting 1 billion real people actively participating in the ecosystem and powering identity, governance, applications, and economic coordination across Web3.


InterLink Human Network
The InterLink Ecosystem is a modular, human-first architecture that connects identity, application, and blockchain infrastructure into one unified network.

At its core is the InterLink ID, a biometric-verified identity layer that ensures every user is a real, unique human. This ID powers the InterLink App, which acts as the primary user interface for accessing decentralized mini-apps in areas like Social, Gaming, AI Agents, and Finance ‚Äî all published through the Mini-App Marketplace.

Developers build these apps using the InterLink MDK (Mini-App Development Kit), which provides essential modules such as authentication, notifications, onchain transactions, and payments. Apps are deployed and managed through the Developer Portal and interact with the network via the InterLink SDK.

Externally, other platforms can integrate InterLink‚Äôs identity verification through the Human Auth SDK, allowing trusted access to external applications.

All verified users become Human Nodes, contributing to network integrity and earning InterLink tokens. These tokens are issued and managed by the InterLink Chain, the decentralized blockchain that anchors identity, reputation, and economic coordination.

InterLink Network
InterLink ID
A privacy-preserving proof of human solution that allows users to verify their uniqueness and humanness while maintaining anonymity.

InterLink ID leverages Proof of Personhood technology to verify that each holder is a unique individual. Designed to be person-bound, InterLink ID is exclusively linked to its owner, preventing transfers or misuse by fraudulent actors. This approach ensures a secure, reliable, and seamless digital identity verification experience. 
InterLink ID Introduction
InterLink ID is the identity layer powering the InterLink Network ‚Äî a human-first blockchain ecosystem designed to bring real people into Web3.


Verifying human
As decentralized applications scale to millions of users, bots, fake accounts, and multi-wallet abuse continue to distort trust, rewards, and governance. InterLink ID is built to solve this by ensuring that every participant is a unique, verified human.


InterLink ID - Unlimited Access
InterLink ID grants users unified access to Mini-Apps and all integrated applications within the InterLink ecosystem.

Unlike traditional wallet-based systems, InterLink ID assigns a one-person-one-identity model across the network. This enables applications to:

Prevent Sybil attacks and bot farming

Ensure fairness in airdrops, governance, and staking

Build social trust and human reputation

Power real-world, compliant identity use cases

InterLink ID is at the heart of our mission to build the world‚Äôs largest human network on-chain ‚Äî a system where people, not programs, define the future of Web3.
InterLink ID Generation Process
InterLink ID is created through a multi-step process that ensures each identity is backed by a real human and resistant to fraud or duplication:


InterLink ID Generation Process
1. Face Scan

The user captures a live facial image using their device‚Äôs camera as the starting point for identity creation.

2. AI Deepfake Checking

The system verifies liveness and authenticity using deepfake detection models, ensuring that the scan is not spoofed or synthetic.

3. Biometric Hashing

The validated facial data is converted into a unique biometric hash ‚Äî a non-reversible representation that ensures uniqueness while preventing identity leakage.

4. Decentralized Storage

The biometric hash and associated metadata are stored securely using decentralized infrastructure, ensuring integrity and tamper-resistance.

5. InterLink ID Issuance

A permanent, unique InterLink ID is generated and bound to the human user. This ID can be used across dApps, governance systems, and Web3 ecosystems.
InterLink ID Credential
To enhance utility and real-world interoperability, InterLink ID supports the optional addition of verified credentials linked directly to each user‚Äôs identity.


Easily add a digital passport, bank card, or driver‚Äôs license.
These credentials include, but are not limited to:

Government-issued documents: Passport, National ID, Driver‚Äôs License

Financial credentials: Bank cards, credit cards, digital payment IDs

Proofs of status: Visa, residency, age, nationality, employment

All credentials are stored locally on the user‚Äôs device and never uploaded or accessible by InterLink or any third party. Through selective disclosure, users can prove facts such as:

‚ÄúI am over 18‚Äù

‚ÄúI have a valid bank account‚Äù

‚ÄúI hold a passport from Country X‚Äù

‚ÄúI am the rightful owner of this identity‚Äù

These verifications can be used to unlock mini-app access, participate in token-gated airdrops, or meet lightweight KYC requirements in decentralized environments ‚Äî all without compromising personal privacy.

By bridging traditional identity and decentralized trust, InterLink transforms identity from a static concept into a modular, user-controlled access layer for Web3 and beyond.
Core Principles
Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)
The InterLink ID architecture follows the principles of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) ‚Äî empowering each user to be the sole owner and controller of their digital identity. In this model, credentials (such as age, nationality, or verification status) are issued by trusted entities or systems and are stored securely within the user‚Äôs InterLink ID.

These credentials are never held by a central server. Instead, they remain encrypted and under the user‚Äôs control, often stored locally or via decentralized infrastructure. When needed, users can generate verifiable proofs ‚Äî such as zero-knowledge attestations ‚Äî to present only the required information (e.g. ‚ÄúOver 18‚Äù) to any verifier, without revealing full personal data.

Core Components of InterLink ID‚Äôs SSI Model

InterLink ID's SSI Model
1. Issuer ‚Äì Credential Provider
Entities that issue verifiable credentials to users. These credentials are digitally signed and can later be used to prove facts without revealing unnecessary personal information.

Examples:

Passport Department ‚Üí Issues age, nationality, legal identity.

Crypto Wallet Platform ‚Üí Issues wallet ownership or transaction activity.

Bank ‚Üí Issues financial trust scores or fiat-KYC verification.

2. Holder ‚Äì User & Identity Owner
The individual who receives and controls credentials. All credentials are encrypted and stored in the user‚Äôs InterLink ID wallet, not on any centralized server.

Key Abilities:

Store credentials securely.

Control who sees what.

Generate selective disclosures (e.g., ‚ÄúOver 18‚Äù without sharing birthdate).

Generate zero-knowledge proofs to prove facts without revealing raw data.

3. Verifier - Credential Consumer
Any system, service, or platform that requests and validates credential proofs from a holder to make access, compliance, or governance decisions.

Examples:

Decentralized Applications ‚Üí Validate user uniqueness, reputation.

Payment Infrastructure ‚Üí Require identity proof for fraud protection or regulatory compliance.

Web3 Services ‚Üí Assess identity-based access for governance, lending, or airdrop participation.

Why This Matters
Traditional KYC systems store your data on central servers. InterLink ID flips that model:

You own your credentials.

You choose what to share, when, and with whom.

Your identity becomes portable across all of Web3 ‚Äî with privacy intact.
Privacy & Security Architecture
Privacy & Security Architecture
At the core of InterLink ID lies a multi-layered privacy architecture, purpose-built to secure human identity while preserving decentralization and usability. This architecture brings together three critical pillars: encrypted biometric data, decentralized storage, and zero-knowledge proof readiness. Together, they form the technological backbone that ensures users retain full control over their identity, without compromising security or privacy.

Encrypted Biometric Data
InterLink ID begins with the biometric verification of real humans ‚Äî a critical step in establishing Proof of Personhood. But unlike traditional identity systems, InterLink encrypts all biometric data at the moment of capture using end-to-end cryptographic methods. This ensures that:

No raw biometric information is ever stored or exposed.

Only the encrypted version of identity data exists, ensuring that even in worst-case scenarios (e.g. data breaches), user privacy remains protected.

The encrypted data can be referenced for verification without revealing the original input.

This approach enables both privacy and integrity ‚Äî the system knows you‚Äôre real, but it doesn‚Äôt need to know who you are.

Decentralized Storage
To eliminate centralized points of failure, InterLink ID stores all identity-related data across decentralized storage layers. By integrating with decentralized file systems (e.g. IPFS or Arweave), the platform guarantees:

Tamper-resistance: no single entity can alter or delete user identity records.

High availability and fault tolerance.

User data remains sovereign and censorship-resistant.

This decentralized approach aligns with our self-sovereign identity model and ensures that InterLink ID operates without relying on any central server or third-party authority.

Zero-Knowledge Proof Readiness
As InterLink evolves, privacy technology must evolve with it. That‚Äôs why the system is designed to be fully zero-knowledge proof (ZK) compatible. ZK cryptography allows users to prove statements ‚Äî such as their uniqueness or access rights ‚Äî without disclosing the underlying data. In practice, this means:

Users can verify their personhood without exposing their biometrics.

Selective disclosure becomes possible (e.g., proving you are over 18 without revealing your birthdate).

Secure participation in on-chain voting, governance, and mini-app access without revealing wallet or identity details.

While full ZK integration may roll out progressively, the current infrastructure is ZK-ready by design. This future-proofs InterLink ID for a privacy-centric Web3.

Together, these three elements ensure that InterLink ID is not just a verification layer ‚Äî but a trust layer, enabling the next generation of human-first decentralized applications.
Prevents Identity Spoofing & Fraud
To ensure secure authentication, advanced technologies such as the TrueDepth Camera System, Face Flashing, and Video-based Liveness Detection are employed. These solutions verify user authenticity in real time, effectively preventing identity spoofing and fraudulent access.


Deepfake Detection & Facial Recognition
1. TrueDepth Camera System
TrueDepth is an advanced camera system developed by Apple, primarily used for Face ID on iPhones and iPads. It combines infrared light and sophisticated software to create a 3D map of the user's face for secure authentication.

2. Face Flashing (Secure Liveness Detection Protocol)
Face Flashing is a secure liveness detection method that uses light reflections to ensure the person in front of the camera is real and not a static image or mask, enhancing security in facial recognition systems.

3. Video-based Liveness Detection
This technology analyzes subtle movements in live video to verify the authenticity of the user's face, preventing spoofing attempts through photos or pre-recorded videos.
NIST FRTE Evaluation
To ensure that InterLink ID meets the highest global standards for biometric performance, our core algorithm ‚Äî interlinklabs_001 ‚Äî was submitted to the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for evaluation under the FRTE (Face Recognition Technology Evaluation) program (see more). 

NIST is the world‚Äôs most recognized authority in biometric benchmarking. Their FRTE 1:1 Verification Track is considered the gold standard for evaluating face recognition systems in identity-matching scenarios. It is used by governments, banks, and enterprise security platforms worldwide to assess the accuracy, speed, and reliability of identity verification algorithms.

1. Performance is measured using two standard metrics

2. FNMR vs. Elapsed Time for Mugshot Images Across Algorithms and Demographics

FNMR Stability Over Time (Ageing Effect)
This chart evaluates how biometric accuracy changes over time ‚Äî specifically how False Non-Match Rate (FNMR) increases as the time gap between two face captures (photos) grows from 2 to 16 years.

üîé Key Observations:
InterLink shows gradual and predictable increase in FNMR as faces age ‚Äî no major spikes, indicating strong resilience to long-term facial changes.

Its curve is consistent across demographics, demonstrating fairness and robustness.

Compared to other algorithms (left panels), InterLink performs competitively ‚Äî even with age gaps of 10‚Äì16 years.

This confirms InterLink‚Äôs suitability for long-term, one-time onboarding use cases such as decentralized identity, KYC, and Proof-of-Personhood.
3. Similarity Scores for Genuine and Impostor Image Pairs

Pair name
The figure shows similarity scores for 12 genuine and 8 impostor image pairs used in the May 2018 paper https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1721355115 Face recognition accuracy of forensic examiners, superrecognizers, and face recognition algorithms (Phillips et al.). The threshold (red horizontal line) is a value calibrated to give FMR = 0.0001 on mugshot images. Points above the threshold correspond to pairs determined to be genuine, and points below the threshold correspond to pairs determined to be impostors. If the determined class (genuine or impostor) matches the real class, points will be blue; if not, red. An X represents face detection failure in either of the images in the pair. Note that the sample size (n=20) is small, and the figure may change substantially if larger or different sets are used. The images can be viewed at

4. False Negative Demographic Effects (Visa-Border Dataset)

This figure presents an analysis of False Non-Match Rates (FNMR) for InterLink‚Äôs biometric algorithm (interlinklabs_001) under varying demographic and quality conditions, using the Visa-Border dataset from NIST.

üìê Methodology:
The system is evaluated at an operating point of

FMR
=
0.00001
 with threshold 
T
=
177.01
FMR=0.00001 with threshold T=177.01
FNMR is computed by comparing low-quality border-crossing photos with high-quality enrollment images (e.g., visa application portraits), across 20+ countries of birth. Each group is segmented by gender and age bin (‚â§45 years vs. >45 years).

üîé Interpretation:
Lower FNMR values indicate better matching accuracy.

Square dots represent empirical FNMR estimates;

Vertical bars represent 95% bootstrap confidence intervals.

Overlapping intervals suggest no statistically significant bias across age or gender.

For women, left, and men, the panels show false non-match rates when mediocre border cross photos are compared against high quality reference application portraits collected from individuals born in the country identified on the horizontal axis and aged either above or below 45 years of age at the time of the application photo. The square dots give the empirical FNMR point estimate. The vertical lines give bootstrap 95-percent confidence intervals around the point estimate. The intervals are wider when the country and age group is less-represented in this dataset. Overlapping intervals is an indication of no significant difference. Low FNMR values are synonymous with high accuracy.

For non-mate comparisons of mugshots of black and white (B-W) males and females (M-F), the panels show false match rates for five algorithms: two for which on-diagonal demographic differentials are low, two for which they're high, and the target algorithm in this report. In the top row of panels the threshold is set for each algorithm to give FMR = 0.001 for white males which is the demographic that usually gives the lowest FMR. In the second row the white-male FMR = 0.0001. This means the top right box is the same color in all panels of a row.

InterLink Chain
Proof of Personhood
The InterLink Chain introduces Proof of Personhood (PoP), a groundbreaking consensus mechanism that secures the network by ensuring only verified human users can participate as validators. Unlike traditional models such as Proof of Work, which relies on computational power, or Proof of Stake, which depends on token ownership, PoP ties validation directly to real human identities through the InterLink ID‚Äîa decentralized identity system anchored in unique biometric data. By requiring validators to hold a verified InterLink ID, PoP effectively prevents Sybil attacks, where malicious actors attempt to dominate the network with multiple fake identities. This human-centric design not only enhances security but also aligns with InterLink‚Äôs mission to create a trustworthy, inclusive, and decentralized ecosystem.

At the heart of PoP lies the InterLink ID, which revolutionizes biometric authentication by eliminating the need for centralized storage of raw biometric data, a common vulnerability in traditional systems. Instead, it leverages zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) and homomorphic encryption to transform biometric inputs‚Äîsuch as facial images or fingerprints‚Äîinto encrypted, irreversible representations. This ensures that each user‚Äôs identity is unique while safeguarding privacy, as no sensitive data is stored or exposed. The process begins in the Enrollment Phase, where a biometric input

C without revealing the hash itself. The decentralized node pool collectively verifies this proof, ensuring secure and private authentication. AI enhancements, such as self-supervised learning (e.g., SimCLR), differential privacy, and GANs, further strengthen the system‚Äôs resilience against attacks and spoofing attempts.

PoP offers critical advantages in security, privacy, and compliance. Its multi-step encryption ensures irreversibility, while cancelability allows re-enrollment with a new transformation matrix if needed. Decentralization eliminates single points of failure, and the system aligns with regulations like GDPR and CCPA by minimizing data exposure and using ZKPs for verification. These features make PoP ideal for applications in finance, healthcare, and government services. Moreover, InterLink ID‚Äôs modular design‚Äîcombining ZKPs with AI-driven biometrics‚Äîensures adaptability to future threats, such as quantum computing, positioning it as a forward-thinking solution for digital identity verification.
Give humans top of block priority
The InterLink Chain is meticulously engineered to place verified human users at the apex of its operational hierarchy, ensuring that real individuals drive the network's activities. This human-first philosophy is operationalized through seamless integration with InterLink ID, a sophisticated identity verification system that serves as the bedrock for transaction prioritization. Unlike traditional blockchains where transactions are processed agnostically based on fees or arrival time, the InterLink Chain employs a novel block construction algorithm. Transactions originating from InterLink ID-verified users are systematically elevated to the "top of the block," guaranteeing expedited processing and inclusion in the blockchain ledger ahead of unverified or automated submissions.

This prioritization is not merely a technical tweak but a foundational principle that enables a range of innovative use cases. Smart contracts deployed on the InterLink Chain can directly interface with the InterLink ID system, querying or mandating proof of unique human identity as a prerequisite for execution. For instance, in decentralized governance protocols, this capability enforces a "one person, one vote" paradigm, thwarting attempts by malicious actors to amplify their influence through multiple accounts. Similarly, reward distribution mechanisms can leverage this feature to ensure equitable allocation, preventing bots or duplicate identities from siphoning incentives intended for genuine participants.

Central to this system is the robustness of the identity verification process, which hinges on advanced biometric technologies. The InterLink Chain incorporates NIST Facial Recognition Technology Evaluation (FRTE)-certified deepfake detection, employing cutting-edge facial recognition and liveness detection algorithms. These measures are designed to withstand sophisticated spoofing attempts, such as video replays or 3D-printed masks, ensuring that only authentic human users pass muster. This biometric rigor marginalizes bots and unverified entities, fostering a network environment that is inherently fair and trustworthy.

To implement this prioritization without compromising scalability, the InterLink Chain utilizes a decentralized network of verification nodes. These nodes operate in parallel to authenticate identities and flag transactions, preventing the verification process from becoming a bottleneck. Privacy is safeguarded through the use of zero-knowledge proofs, enabling users to confirm their humanity without exposing sensitive biometric data. While this approach introduces some complexity‚Äîsuch as the need to balance verification speed with security‚Äîit positions the InterLink Chain as a pioneer in creating a blockchain ecosystem that genuinely serves real people.
The foundation layer behind all InterLink Mini-Apps
The InterLink Chain stands as the architectural cornerstone of the InterLink ecosystem, providing a high-performance, scalable platform that underpins the development and deployment of decentralized applications (dApps), notably the InterLink Mini-Apps. Designed with developer accessibility in mind, the chain supports Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible smart contracts. This compatibility allows developers versed in Ethereum‚Äôs toolchain‚Äîsuch as Solidity and Truffle‚Äîto seamlessly transition to InterLink, accelerating the creation of innovative applications without requiring a steep learning curve.

Performance is a hallmark of the InterLink Chain, with a target throughput of 10,000 transactions per second (TPS) and a finality time of just 2 seconds. These metrics are achieved through a combination of an optimized consensus mechanism and a sharded network architecture, which distributes transaction processing across multiple nodes to maximize efficiency. Unlike many blockchains that struggle with congestion during peak usage, the InterLink Chain‚Äôs design ensures that users experience minimal latency, making it an ideal foundation for real-time, user-facing applications.

The InterLink Software Development Kit (SDK) amplifies this foundation by equipping developers with a rich suite of tools to craft InterLink Mini-Apps‚Äîlightweight, modular dApps tailored to leverage the chain‚Äôs unique attributes. A standout feature is the integration of verified human identity, courtesy of InterLink ID. This enables mini-apps to embed trust and authenticity into their core functionality. For example, a decentralized social platform could use identity verification to eliminate fake profiles, while a peer-to-peer marketplace could reduce fraud by ensuring all traders are verified humans. These capabilities unlock new paradigms of interaction that generic blockchains, lacking native identity layers, cannot replicate.

The mini-apps themselves are engineered for agility, supporting rapid deployment and iterative updates to meet evolving user demands. The chain‚Äôs high throughput and fast finality ensure that these applications scale effortlessly, even as adoption grows. By blending EVM compatibility, exceptional performance, and identity-driven innovation, the InterLink Chain establishes itself as the definitive platform for the next wave of human-centric decentralized applications.
Sybil Resistance
Sybil attacks‚Äîwhere a single entity floods a network with fictitious identities to subvert its operations‚Äîrepresent a persistent vulnerability in decentralized systems. The InterLink Chain confronts this threat with a multi-layered defense anchored in its requirement that all validators possess a verified InterLink ID. This mandate ensures that each validator is a distinct, real human, drastically raising the bar for attackers attempting to amass influence through fake identities.

The linchpin of this Sybil-resistant design is the Proof of Personhood (PoP) consensus mechanism, a groundbreaking departure from traditional models like Proof of Work or Proof of Stake. In PoP, the right to validate transactions and produce blocks is tied directly to verified human identity rather than computational resources or token holdings. This human-centric approach distributes network control equitably among real individuals, rendering it computationally and logistically infeasible for a single entity to dominate through identity proliferation.

The efficacy of PoP hinges on the InterLink ID verification process, which employs state-of-the-art biometric technologies. Featuring top-tier facial recognition and liveness detection‚Äîevaluated against NIST benchmarks‚Äîthis system is engineered to detect and reject impersonation attempts, from deepfake videos to physical replicas. By embedding such rigorous checks into the validator onboarding process, the InterLink Chain ensures that only genuine humans can participate in consensus, safeguarding the network‚Äôs integrity.

To enhance resilience, the chain incorporates a dynamic reputation system for validators. Performance metrics and adherence to protocol rules are continuously tracked, with underperforming or malicious validators subject to penalties or expulsion. Privacy is preserved through zero-knowledge proofs, allowing validators to prove their identity without disclosing personal data. While no system is impervious‚Äîpotential risks like biometric data breaches remain‚Äîthe InterLink Chain mitigates these through decentralized verification nodes and ongoing algorithmic enhancements. This comprehensive strategy positions it as a bulwark against Sybil attacks, upholding trust and security at scale.
Aiming to be the world's most human blockchain network
The InterLink Chain transcends the conventional blockchain paradigm, aspiring to forge a Web3 ecosystem where human participation is the cornerstone. By anchoring every interaction to a verified InterLink ID, it tackles entrenched challenges that undermine decentralized networks: the proliferation of bots, the distortion of governance through Sybil attacks, and the exploitation of multi-wallet schemes. This human-centric ethos distinguishes it from generic blockchains, which often treat all actors‚Äîhuman or otherwise‚Äîas equal, inadvertently enabling abuse.

Bots and fake accounts erode trust in digital systems, from manipulating markets to flooding social platforms with spam. The InterLink Chain counters this by ensuring that only verified humans can engage meaningfully, relegating automated entities to the periphery. Similarly, multi-wallet abuse‚Äîwhere users hoard rewards or voting power through multiple identities‚Äîis nullified by linking privileges to a single, unique human ID. These solutions foster an equitable environment where resources and influence are distributed based on authentic participation.

The chain‚Äôs architecture is purpose-built for this vision, integrating secure, scalable, and privacy-preserving identity management into its core. This makes it an unparalleled foundation for applications demanding trust and fairness, such as decentralized finance platforms requiring KYC-like assurances, social networks free of impersonators, or governance systems immune to vote rigging. Unlike traditional blockchains retrofitted with add-on solutions, the InterLink Chain embeds these capabilities natively, offering a cohesive and efficient platform.

Growth is propelled by incentive structures, including mining rewards and referral bonuses, which encourage users to verify their identities and expand the network. This aligns individual participation with the collective ambition of creating the world‚Äôs largest on-chain human network. By empowering real people to shape a digital future rooted in authenticity and equity, the InterLink Chain redefines the role of blockchain technology, positioning itself as the vanguard of a more human Web3.
Human Node in the InterLink Chain
In the InterLink Chain, a Human Node is a verified human participant who serves as the backbone of the network‚Äôs decentralized operations. Authenticated via the innovative InterLink ID system, Human Nodes are tasked with validating transactions, shaping governance, and earning rewards, embodying a paradigm shift toward a truly human-centric blockchain. This design tackles pervasive issues in decentralized systems‚Äîsuch as bot-driven manipulation, Sybil attacks, and multi-wallet exploitation‚Äîby anchoring every critical action to a unique, verified human identity. The result is a robust, trustworthy framework that prioritizes authenticity and fairness in the Web3 landscape.

Core Functionality of Human Nodes
Human Nodes are the operational heartbeat of the InterLink Chain, driving both transaction validation and network governance with a bespoke consensus mechanism: Delegated Proof of Personhood (PoP). Unlike conventional proof-of-stake or proof-of-work systems, PoP integrates human verification into the validation process, ensuring that only real individuals can act as delegates. Each Human Node stakes InterLink Tokens to participate, with their eligibility further refined by a reputation score‚Äîa metric reflecting their historical reliability, participation frequency, and compliance with network protocols. Delegates are periodically elected based on a weighted combination of stake and reputation, creating a dynamic yet secure validator pool.

For transaction validation, Human Nodes process and confirm blocks using a streamlined protocol. Transactions are batched into blocks, which delegates verify for correctness (e.g., ensuring proper signatures and adherence to smart contract rules) before appending them to the chain. This process leverages a Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)-inspired approach, where a supermajority of Human Nodes must agree to achieve consensus, ensuring resilience against malicious actors while maintaining efficiency.

Governance is equally human-driven. Human Nodes propose and vote on critical network decisions‚Äîranging from protocol upgrades to resource allocation‚Äîvia a transparent, on-chain voting system. Voting power scales with a node‚Äôs stake and reputation, but a cap on influence per node prevents centralization. Proposals require a quorum of participation and a threshold of approval, ensuring decisions reflect broad human consensus rather than the whims of a few.

Seamless Integration with InterLink ID
The InterLink ID system is the technological linchpin that distinguishes Human Nodes from traditional blockchain actors. It employs a multi-layered verification process to certify human uniqueness, combining biometric authentication (e.g., facial recognition or voice mapping) with behavioral attestation (e.g., analyzing interaction patterns over time). This data is processed through a privacy-preserving pipeline powered by zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and secure multi-party computation (SMPC). ZKPs allow users to prove their humanity and uniqueness without disclosing raw biometric data, while SMPC distributes verification across trusted nodes to prevent any single point of failure or data exposure.

Once verified, a user‚Äôs InterLink ID is cryptographically bound to their on-chain identity, stored as a hash on the blockchain with sensitive details encrypted off-chain in a decentralized storage layer (e.g., IPFS with encryption). This setup ensures that Human Nodes can operate pseudonymously while the network retains confidence in their authenticity. Periodic re-verification‚Äîtriggered by time intervals or flagged anomalies‚Äîmaintains the system‚Äôs integrity without overburdening users, striking a balance between security and usability.

Incentives and Reward Mechanisms
The InterLink Chain encourages Human Node participation through a streamlined reward system designed to secure and expand the Web3 network. Rewards, distributed in InterLink Tokens, are earned via two key mechanisms:

Mining Rewards: Each individual can create a single Human Node and earn tokens by actively mining every 4 hours. This consistent participation is far more than a token-earning opportunity‚Äîit‚Äôs the backbone of the InterLink Network‚Äôs flawless operation. During each mining session, Human Nodes perform essential tasks such as validating transactions, ensuring their accuracy and legitimacy, and safeguarding the network against potential threats. This regular, distributed effort strengthens the network‚Äôs security by making it computationally challenging for malicious actors to disrupt operations. Moreover, the 4-hour mining cycle fosters continuous engagement, ensuring that the network remains active, resilient, and decentralized. As each node contributes its computational power or validation capacity, the collective effort of all Human Nodes creates a robust system capable of adapting to challenges while maintaining peak performance. The tokens earned are proportional to these efforts, aligning individual incentives with the network‚Äôs overall health.

Referral Incentives: Nodes can amplify their Human Hash Power by referring others to join the network. This two-tier system offers increased rewards: Level 1 rewards come from direct referrals, while Level 2 rewards are earned from the referrals of those in Level 1. More referrals lead to faster mining and greater token earnings, fostering network growth. Beyond individual benefits, this mechanism enhances the network‚Äôs operational integrity by driving exponential expansion. Each new node increases the total mining capacity, distributing the workload across a broader and more diverse participant base. This diversification bolsters decentralization, reducing the risk of centralized control and enhancing resilience. The referral system creates a virtuous cycle: as the network grows, it becomes more secure and efficient, rewarding those who contribute to its expansion while ensuring that the benefits of growth are shared across the ecosystem.

This incentivization model promotes active engagement and network expansion while ensuring that contributions directly benefit both the individual and the broader ecosystem. Mining rewards guarantee that the network is continuously maintained and secured by an active community of Human Nodes, while referral incentives fuel its growth and adaptability. Together, these mechanisms establish a self-regulating environment where every participant‚Äôs efforts‚Äîwhether through mining or referrals‚Äîdirectly contribute to the InterLink Network‚Äôs perfect functioning. By aligning rewards with participation and network health, InterLink creates a sustainable Web3 ecosystem that thrives on collective effort, providing a secure and scalable foundation for the future.

Transformative Impact on the Web3 Ecosystem
The Human Node model redefines the Web3 paradigm by centering it around verified human agency, with far-reaching implications:

Eradicating Bot Influence: By restricting meaningful participation to Human Nodes, the chain eliminates bot-driven distortions in social platforms, gaming economies, and DeFi systems, ensuring interactions reflect real human intent.

Thwarting Sybil Attacks: The one-human, one-node rule, enforced by InterLink ID, renders identity spoofing impractical, safeguarding voting, reward distribution, and resource allocation.

Curbing Multi-Wallet Exploitation: Linking privileges to a single verified identity prevents users from gaming systems through multiple accounts, promoting equitable access to opportunities like airdrops or governance power.

Beyond security, this approach democratizes Web3 by empowering individuals over institutions or whales. It lays the groundwork for applications requiring high trust‚Äîthink decentralized social networks free of spam, DAOs with genuine member-driven governance, or NFT marketplaces immune to artificial hype. The InterLink Chain thus emerges as a pioneer in building a Web3 ecosystem where authenticity is the currency of influence.

Robust Technical Architecture
The InterLink Chain‚Äôs architecture is engineered for scale, security, and human integration:

Identity Sharding: To manage millions of Human Nodes, the chain shards identity verification across parallel subnets. Each shard handles a subset of InterLink ID checks, reducing bottlenecks and enabling linear scalability.

Efficient Consensus: PoP optimizes for speed by limiting active validators to a rotating subset of high-reputation nodes, achieving sub-second transaction finality while preserving decentralization through frequent re-elections.

Privacy-First Design: ZKPs and off-chain encrypted storage ensure that identity data remains confidential, with on-chain hashes serving as tamper-proof references. This complies with privacy standards like GDPR while supporting trustless operations.

Load Balancing: A hybrid layer-2 solution offloads routine validations to sidechains, with Human Nodes anchoring final settlement on the main chain, enhancing throughput without compromising security.

This architecture not only supports current operations but anticipates future growth, positioning the InterLink Chain to onboard a global population of Human Nodes without sacrificing performance or integrity.

HumanPad Device
üåç HumanPad: Enabling Real Human Verification for Everyone

We are building the foundational infrastructure for the Real Human Network, with the ambitious goal of verifying 1 billion real users worldwide. While our technology is designed to scale infinitely, a key challenge remains: in many parts of Africa and other underdeveloped regions, access to devices with high-quality cameras‚Äîrequired for biometric verification‚Äîis still limited.

To address this, we introduce HumanPad.


The Human Scan device makes scaling more efficient and seamless.
HumanPad is a compact, AI-powered device ‚Äî roughly the size of an iPod Shuffle, but equipped with an AI-powered camera system and high-resolution sensors specifically optimized for human verification. These devices will be distributed globally, especially in underserved areas, to ensure that anyone, anywhere can verify their humanity and join the InterLink ecosystem.

Unlike typical mobile devices, the primary function of HumanPad is not to make calls or run everyday apps. Its sole focus is to verify real humans efficiently and securely. However, the full potential of this device may evolve as the network grows.

Beyond identity verification, HumanPad represents a gateway to financial inclusion. In many regions, over 1.3 billion people remain excluded from the formal financial system, simply because they lack formal identity documentation. HumanPad can serve as a trusted verification point for services such as:

Lending & Borrowing

Savings & Micropayments

Basic financial access

By anchoring digital identity in a decentralized, verifiable, and human-first model, HumanPad empowers populations previously left behind, unlocking access to Web3, finance, and opportunity on a global scale.


HumanPad works like an AI-powered wearable ‚Äî smart, stylish, and human-first.
HumanPad is more than a human verification tool ‚Äî it‚Äôs a minimalist, wearable AI device purpose-built for real people.

Designed with minimalism and functionality in mind, HumanPad runs on lightweight AI models to perform real-time verification, respond to user input, and act as an edge-level identity engine.

It functions as a personal AI device ‚Äî powered by AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) ‚Äî that learns from each user‚Äôs encrypted identity data stored via InterLink ID.
This enables more accurate, adaptive, and private interactions, tailored to each individual without exposing personal information or relying on cloud processing.

Vision: HumanPad ‚Äî The Next Billion Global Device

We believe HumanPad will be the next billion-user breakthrough ‚Äî a wearable AI device that becomes as culturally essential as the smartphone, AirPods, or Apple Watch.

In a world shifting toward ambient AI and personalized assistance, HumanPad is designed to be worn ‚Äî not carried. It‚Äôs not just about technology, it‚Äôs about daily utility, emotional connection, and social identity. A product that feels natural to wear, yet powerful enough to carry your personal AI wherever you go.

This is not a gadget. It‚Äôs a global habit in the making ‚Äî the first AI-native wearable built for real people, everywhere.

2. Credential-Enabled

InterLink ID Credentials
Privacy-Preserving Identity Meets Real-World Payments

Each InterLink Card is linked not only to a wallet but also to the user‚Äôs verifiable credentials stored in their InterLink ID. These credentials may include:

NFC-enabled Passport

National ID

Driver‚Äôs License

KYC Level, Age, or Jurisdiction Tags

InterLink Card also enables users to connect valid forms of government-issued ID (e.g. NFC passports) to their InterLink ID ‚Äî without exposing personal information to any third party.

At its simplest, a card equipped with NFC and connected to a verified InterLink ID can already serve as a secure and user-friendly payment method ‚Äî replacing traditional plastic cards and passwords with tap-and-go access powered by identity.

But beyond ease of use, hese credentials are used to unlock or restrict payment permissions depending on context. For example:

Enable or restrict cross-border spending based on passport verification

Allow age-restricted purchases only if ID is linked

With face and passport verification qualifies as KYC/AML-ready for most payment use cases.

Future use: automate spending tiers, discounts, or access based on verified status

The result is a payment card that adapts to your real-world identity, while keeping your personal information private and under your control.

Proof of Concept
Human Infrastructure for a Verified Internet
We are building the foundational infrastructure for the Real Human Network.

In the age of AI, today we have a problem with data for AI models. That‚Äôs why a large % of it is artificially generated to give models even more data.

But in that case, AI can generate too much low-quality information, just because it is trying to be like a human. Moreover, we (humans) use more & more AI-generated info on the internet. when new models are preparing, they start to use human data without understanding this data is from AI‚Ä¶

This isn‚Äôt just a technical issue ‚Äî it‚Äôs a fundamental threat to the future of digital society.


That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre building the Human Layer ‚Äî the core layer of the internet, where applications, Layer 1/2 chains, and platforms can build on top.

It anchors everything back to one critical truth: real humans matter. And they must be verifiable.

This long-term infrastructure includes:

 ‚Ä¢ Human Digital ID (face, orb, HumanPad etc.)

 ‚Ä¢ Mini App Ecosystem ‚Äì a Decentralized App Store for verified humans

 ‚Ä¢ Wallet & Payment Infrastructure (Card, Qr)

 ‚Ä¢ Social Layer & SDKs

 ‚Ä¢ Super AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)
 Proof of Concept
InterLink ID: Proof of Personhood
Introduction to Proof of Personhood
Decentralized networks thrive on the principles of trust, fairness, and equal participation, yet they face persistent challenges in verifying the authenticity and uniqueness of their participants. Sybil attacks, where malicious actors create multiple fraudulent identities to gain disproportionate influence, threaten the integrity of these systems. Traditional consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) exacerbate this issue by tying influence to computational power or financial resources, often leading to centralization and marginalizing less-resourced participants. This misalignment with the democratic ethos of decentralization has spurred the need for a novel approach: Proof of Personhood (PoP).

PoP redefines network participation by anchoring it to the verification of unique human identities, ensuring that each participant has an equal voice regardless of external resources. This paradigm shift is critical for applications like decentralized governance, where equitable decision-making is paramount, and for economic models that aim to distribute rewards fairly across a community. InterLink ID‚Äôs implementation of PoP addresses the dual challenges of Sybil resistance and inclusivity, establishing a foundation for trust in decentralized ecosystems.

To formalize PoP, consider a network with a participant set 
I
I, where each 
i
‚àà
I
i‚ààI represents an entity seeking to participate. A credential verification function 
C
:
I
‚Üí
0
,
1
C:I‚Üí0,1 assigns 
C
(
i
)
=
1
C(i)=1 if 
i
i is authenticated as a unique human, and 
C
(
i
)
=
0
C(i)=0 otherwise. Uniqueness is enforced such that for any two participants 
i
j
,
i
k
‚àà
I
i 
j
‚Äã
 ,i 
k
‚Äã
 ‚ààI, if 
C
(
i
j
)
=
C
(
i
k
)
=
1
C(i 
j
‚Äã
 )=C(i 
k
‚Äã
 )=1, then 
i
j
‚â†
i
k
i 
j
‚Äã
 
ÓÄ†
=i 
k
‚Äã
 . Engagement is modeled via a participation function 
P
:
I
‚Üí
0
,
1
P:I‚Üí0,1, where 
P
(
i
)
=
1
P(i)=1 indicates active involvement (e.g., voting, staking, or contributing), and 
P
(
i
)
=
0
P(i)=0 denotes inactivity.

Voting power 
V
(
i
)
V(i) for participant 
i
i is then defined as:

V
(
i
)
=
C
(
i
)
‚ãÖ
P
(
i
)
‚àë
j
=
1
n
C
(
i
j
)
‚ãÖ
P
(
i
j
)
V(i)= 
‚àë 
j=1
n
‚Äã
 C(i 
j
‚Äã
 )‚ãÖP(i 
j
‚Äã
 )
C(i)‚ãÖP(i)
‚Äã
 
This formula normalizes voting power across all verified, active participants, ensuring the total sums to 1 and reflecting a truly democratic allocation. The rationale behind this design is twofold: it prevents resource-based dominance (as seen in PoW/PoS) and incentivizes active participation, fostering a vibrant and engaged community. For example, in a network of 1,000 participants where 800 are verified and active, each would hold 
V
(
i
)
=
1
/
800
=
0.00125
V(i)=1/800=0.00125, an equal share that scales dynamically as participation changes.

Beyond governance, PoP has implications for identity-based applications, such as universal basic income (UBI) distribution in decentralized economies or access control in peer-to-peer systems. By tying influence to personhood rather than capital, InterLink ID aligns with the vision of a decentralized future where human agency, not wealth, drives collective outcomes.

Core Components of Proof of Personhood
The efficacy of PoP hinges on a robust framework of interdependent components, each addressing specific challenges in identity verification. InterLink ID‚Äôs approach integrates advanced technologies and thoughtful design to ensure security, usability, and resilience. Below, we explore these components in detail, including their theoretical underpinnings, practical implementations, and the trade-offs they navigate.

Deduplication
Uniqueness is the bedrock of PoP, as duplicate identities undermine trust and fairness. Traditional systems often rely on static identifiers (e.g., email addresses or government IDs), which are easily replicated or forged. InterLink ID employs biometric deduplication, leveraging the inherent uniqueness of human physiology‚Äîsuch as facial features or iris patterns‚Äîto ensure one credential per person. This is paired with decentralized identity protocols, distributing verification across a network to eliminate single points of failure.
Challenges and Trade-offs: Biometric systems must balance accuracy with inclusivity (e.g., accommodating diverse populations) and protect against spoofing (e.g., deep fakes). InterLink ID mitigates these risks with liveness detection and continuous model updates, ensuring robustness at scale.

Authentication
Credentials must be secure against unauthorized use, even if stolen or transferred. InterLink ID uses biometric authentication, requiring real-time verification (e.g., a facial scan) to unlock credentials. This ‚Äúsomething you are‚Äù factor contrasts with weaker ‚Äúsomething you know‚Äù (passwords) or ‚Äúsomething you have‚Äù (keys) methods, offering superior security. For instance, a stolen wallet private key becomes useless without the owner‚Äôs biometric match.
Practical Example: In a decentralized voting scenario, a user authenticates via a facial scan on their device, ensuring only they can cast their vote, even if their device is compromised.
Trade-offs: Usability must be balanced with security; overly complex processes could deter adoption. InterLink ID streamlines this with user-friendly interfaces and rapid verification (<2 seconds).

Recovery
Credential loss‚Äîdue to device failure, theft, or user error‚Äîrequires secure, accessible recovery options. InterLink ID offers a multi-tiered recovery system:

User-Managed Backup: Encrypted credentials stored locally or in cloud backups, restorable with a secondary biometric check.

Social Recovery: A quorum of trusted contacts (e.g., 3 of 5) verifies the user‚Äôs identity to regenerate credentials, leveraging decentralized trust.

Issuer Re-Authentication: Users re-verify with the issuer using biometrics, akin to replacing a lost passport.

e-Issuance: New credentials invalidate old ones, deterring black-market trading.
Broader Implications: This flexibility enhances user autonomy while maintaining security, critical for adoption in regions with limited technical infrastructure.

Revocation
Compromised or maliciously issued credentials must be nullified without disrupting the system. In InterLink ID‚Äôs decentralized model, revocation is granular‚Äîonly affected credentials are voided, preserving overall trust. For example, if a rogue issuer is detected, only their credentials are revoked via a consensus mechanism.
Technical Detail: Revocation lists are maintained on-chain, with zero-knowledge proofs ensuring privacy during status checks.
Trade-offs: Frequent revocations could burden the network; InterLink ID optimizes this with efficient indexing and periodic audits.

Expiry
Credentials must evolve with security threats, such as advances in quantum computing or biometric spoofing. InterLink ID introduces optional expiry dates, prompting periodic re-verification (e.g., every 5 years). This mirrors real-world IDs and ensures long-term resilience.
Future-Proofing: Expiry enables integration of next-generation cryptographic methods, maintaining PoP‚Äôs edge against emerging risks.

These components collectively form a holistic PoP system, addressing the spectrum of identity challenges from creation to retirement. InterLink ID‚Äôs emphasis on user control and decentralized trust distinguishes it from centralized predecessors, aligning with Web3‚Äôs ethos.

Solving Proof of Personhood at Scale
Scaling PoP to a global level demands a system that is inclusive, secure, and efficient across billions of users. Existing identity solutions‚Äîgovernment IDs, social media accounts, or KYC processes‚Äîfall short due to exclusion, fraud vulnerability, or centralization. InterLink ID‚Äôs PoP framework meets these stringent requirements:

Inclusivity and Scalability: Over 1 billion people lack formal identification, per World Bank estimates. Biometrics transcend this barrier, requiring only a smartphone camera‚Äîalready ubiquitous with 6.8 billion users worldwide (2023 data). InterLink ID‚Äôs cloud-based verification scales linearly with user growth, leveraging distributed nodes for global coverage.
Example: A farmer in rural Kenya, without a passport, verifies their identity via a facial scan, joining a decentralized cooperative.

Fraud Resistance: Sybil attacks thrive on cheap identity creation. Biometrics, combined with liveness detection and ZKPs, raise the cost of fraud exponentially‚Äîforging a face is far harder than spoofing an email.
Technical Insight: Deduplication compares biometric hashes across the network, flagging duplicates in real time.

Personbound Credentials: Transferring biometric-tied credentials is futile without the owner‚Äôs physical presence, deterring theft. Recovery mechanisms further ensure only legitimate owners regain access.
Use Case: In a P2P lending platform, lenders trust borrowers‚Äô verified identities, reducing default risks.

Decentralization: Centralized systems risk censorship and breaches (e.g., Equifax 2017). InterLink ID‚Äôs blockchain-based architecture distributes issuance and verification, with no single entity controlling the network.
Resilience: A node failure in Asia doesn‚Äôt affect Europe, ensuring uptime.

Privacy: Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) enable verification without data exposure, aligning with GDPR and CCPA. Users prove uniqueness without revealing biometrics, retaining sovereignty over their data.
Regulatory Advantage: Privacy-by-design enhances market acceptance in privacy-sensitive regions.

InterLink ID‚Äôs biometric-driven, decentralized approach overcomes the limitations of prior systems, offering a scalable identity layer for Web3 applications‚Äîfrom DAOs to tokenized economies.

Evaluating Verification Mechanisms
The choice of verification method shapes PoP‚Äôs effectiveness. InterLink ID evaluates alternatives against criteria like security, inclusivity, and privacy:

Online Accounts: Email or social media logins are trivial to multiply (e.g., bot farms) and exclude offline populations.
Weakness: No inherent uniqueness; 1 user can control 1,000 accounts.

Official ID Verification (KYC): Robust for those with IDs but excludes 50%+ of the global population without digital records. Privacy risks abound as users share sensitive data with third parties.
Limitation: Fake IDs and centralized storage invite fraud and breaches.

Web of Trust: Peers vouching for each other builds community trust but scales poorly and succumbs to deep fakes or collusion.
Risk: A Sybil attacker could infiltrate trust circles.

Social Graph Analysis: Mapping relationships to infer uniqueness is slow, AI-vulnerable (e.g., fake profiles), and excludes isolated individuals.
Drawback: Bias toward socially connected users.

Biometrics: Facial scans offer near-universal access, high accuracy (99.9% with modern models), and privacy via ZKPs. InterLink ID‚Äôs choice reflects its strengths: stability, forgery resistance, and scalability.
Advantage: A 2022 study showed facial recognition outperforms other biometrics in diverse settings.

InterLink ID‚Äôs biometric-ZKP hybrid outperforms alternatives by balancing security with inclusivity, making it ideal for global PoP deployment.

InterLink ID‚Äôs Verification Process

 . Liveness detection (e.g., eye blinks) prevents spoofing.
Scalability: Cloud-based inference handles millions of verifications daily.

Decentralized Identity Protocols
Credentials are minted as NFTs on a blockchain, with smart contracts managing issuance and revocation. Users control private keys, ensuring sovereignty.
Security: Tamper-proof ledgers log all actions anonymously.

Zero-Knowledge Proofs
ZKPs (e.g., zk-SNARKs) prove biometric matches without revealing data. A user‚Äôs hash 
H
(
F
)
H(F) is committed on-chain, verified via: 
œÄ
=
Prove
(
H
(

œÄ=Prove(H(F),C) where 
œÄ
œÄ is the proof and

Privacy: Nodes verify without seeing 
H

H(F).

This process, detailed in Figure 1: Proof of Personhood Verification Flow, ensures trust and efficiency across use cases like voting or payments.

Backup Mechanism for Intermediate Nodes
In decentralized systems, resilience against failures or attacks is paramount. Intermediate nodes in InterLink ID store encrypted biometric embeddings and serve as a critical layer between clients and the aggregator in the federated learning process. A robust backup mechanism ensures system continuity, data integrity, and security, making it a cornerstone of the system's reliability.

Importance of Backup Mechanisms
The backup mechanism addresses several critical needs:

Fault Tolerance: Node failures due to hardware issues, power outages, or network disruptions are inevitable in a global system. Backups ensure uninterrupted operation.

Data Integrity: Encrypted biometric embeddings must remain consistent and uncorrupted, as any loss or alteration could compromise deduplication or authentication accuracy.

Security: Targeted attacks, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) or ransomware, could disable nodes. A backup system mitigates these risks by distributing and safeguarding data.

Scalability: As the network grows to millions or billions of users, the backup mechanism ensures that increased load or node failures do not degrade performance.

Without such a mechanism, the system risks single points of failure, undermining the decentralized promise of resilience and trust.

Technical Implementation
InterLink ID‚Äôs backup mechanism is a sophisticated, multi-layered system designed for robustness and efficiency:

Redundant Storage with Erasure Coding: Biometric embeddings are encrypted and split into fragments using erasure coding (e.g., Reed-Solomon codes). These fragments are distributed across multiple nodes such that the original data can be reconstructed from a subset (e.g., 6 of 10 fragments). This approach optimizes storage while ensuring availability even if some nodes are offline.

Real-Time Monitoring and Health Checks: A decentralized monitoring network uses heartbeat signals and anomaly detection (e.g., based on LSTM models) to assess node health. Metrics like latency, uptime, and security events are tracked, with alerts triggered for anomalies such as sudden traffic spikes or unauthorized access attempts.

Automatic Failover with Consensus: Upon detecting a node failure or breach, a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus mechanism among healthy nodes activates backup nodes. The failover process, completed in under 100 milliseconds, reassigns tasks and data access seamlessly, maintaining system continuity.

Data Integrity and Versioning: Each embedding is tagged with a cryptographic hash (e.g., SHA-256) and a version number. Periodic integrity checks compare stored hashes against originals, while versioning ensures that updates (e.g., from model retraining) are synchronized across backups without conflicts.

Geographic Distribution: Nodes are strategically placed across regions (e.g., North America, Asia, Europe) to reduce latency and enhance resilience against regional outages or censorship. A content delivery network (CDN)-like structure optimizes data retrieval from the nearest available backup.

Practical Example
Imagine a scenario in Southeast Asia where a typhoon causes power outages, disabling 20% of intermediate nodes. The monitoring system detects the failures within seconds, and the BFT consensus activates backup nodes in unaffected regions (e.g., Japan and Australia). Erasure-coded fragments are reassembled from surviving nodes, ensuring that biometric verification requests from users continue without interruption. Post-recovery, the system rebalances data distribution as nodes come back online, demonstrating adaptability and resilience.

Broader Implications
This backup mechanism not only ensures operational continuity but also builds user trust by demonstrating that their identity data remains secure and accessible under adverse conditions. It supports use cases like disaster response, where decentralized identity verification could enable rapid aid distribution, or global elections, where uptime is non-negotiable. By integrating redundancy, monitoring, and failover, InterLink ID sets a benchmark for reliable decentralized systems.

Figure 2: Backup Architecture for Intermediate Nodes illustrates this fault-tolerant design, showing the interplay of redundant storage, monitoring, and failover across a distributed node network.

Privacy-Preserving Biometric Encryption
Traditional biometric systems store raw data centrally, exposing users to privacy breaches and identity theft. InterLink ID‚Äôs privacy-preserving biometric encryption transforms biometric features into secure, irreversible representations, ensuring that sensitive data is neither exposed nor stored in a vulnerable state. This approach is integral to maintaining user sovereignty and trust in a decentralized identity system.

How Privacy-Preserving Biometric Encryption Works
The encryption process combines advanced cryptography and AI techniques for maximum security and privacy:

Feature Extraction
A facial scan is processed using a convolutional neural network (e.g., ResNet-50 or Vision Transformers) to extract a 512-dimensional feature vector ( F \in \mathbb{R}^{512} ). This vector captures unique biometric traits (e.g., distances between facial landmarks) while discarding extraneous details like lighting or background.

Secure Transformation
The feature vector is transformed to prevent reverse-engineering:

Biometric Salting: A user-specific random salt is applied via a non-linear function (e.g., a keyed hash), decorrelating the vector‚Äôs components. This ensures that even identical biometric inputs (e.g., from twins) produce distinct outputs.

Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH): The salted vector is mapped to a binary hash using LSH, preserving similarity for matching (e.g., Hamming distance < threshold) while obfuscating exact values. This hash is typically 256 bits, balancing compactness with security.

Zero-Knowledge Encryption
The binary hash is encrypted into a commitment using a ZKP scheme like Pedersen commitments: 
C
=
g
H
(
F
)
‚ãÖ
h
r
C=g 
H(F)
 ‚ãÖh 
r
 , where 
g
g and 
h
h are generators, 
H
(
F
)
H(F) is the hash, and 
r
r is a random nonce. This commitment is stored on-chain, allowing verification without revealing 
H
(
F
)
H(F). During authentication, users generate a proof 
œÄ
œÄ using zk-SNARKs to demonstrate that their biometric matches the commitment.

Decentralized Storage and Verification
Commitments are distributed across intermediate nodes using a sharding protocol. Verification occurs via a distributed ledger, where nodes collectively validate proofs without accessing the underlying data. This eliminates central honeypots and reduces breach risks.

AI-Powered Enhancements
The system leverages AI to bolster security and adaptability:

Self-Supervised Learning (SSL): Trains feature extractors on unlabeled data, improving robustness across diverse populations (e.g., varying skin tones or ages).

Differential Privacy (DP): Adds calibrated noise to feature vectors before hashing, ensuring that statistical analysis cannot reconstruct individual inputs.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): Simulates spoofing attempts (e.g., 3D masks) to train liveness detection, achieving a false acceptance rate below 0.01%.


Figure 3: Privacy-Preserving Biometric Encryption Process
Benefits of Privacy-Preserving Biometric Encryption
This approach delivers significant advantages:

Irreversibility: The layered transformations (salting, LSH, ZKPs) make it computationally infeasible to recover the original biometric data, even with quantum attacks.

Cancelability: A compromised hash can be invalidated and replaced by applying a new salt, allowing re-enrollment without changing the user‚Äôs biometrics.

Decentralization: Sharded storage across nodes ensures no single entity can access or misuse the full dataset.

Privacy and Compliance: ZKPs and DP align with GDPR, CCPA, and emerging privacy laws, giving users control and regulators confidence.

Spoofing Resistance: AI enhancements and liveness checks thwart presentation attacks, maintaining system integrity.

Real-World Applications
The technology supports diverse use cases:

Finance: A bank uses InterLink ID for KYC, authenticating customers via encrypted biometrics without storing raw data, reducing liability and fraud.

Healthcare: Patients access records securely via telemedicine platforms, with encrypted biometrics ensuring HIPAA compliance and privacy.

Voting: A decentralized election system verifies voters globally, using privacy-preserving encryption to prevent coercion or data leaks while ensuring one vote per person.

Humanitarian Aid: NGOs distribute aid in refugee camps, verifying identities without creating exploitable centralized databases.

Technical Integration
This encryption integrates seamlessly with InterLink ID‚Äôs broader system. The encrypted commitments feed into the deduplication process, ensuring uniqueness without compromising privacy. Backup nodes store sharded commitments, leveraging the failover mechanism to maintain availability. The result is a cohesive identity framework where privacy and resilience reinforce each other.

Figure 3: Privacy-Preserving Biometric Encryption Process visualizes this workflow, from feature extraction to decentralized verification, highlighting the layered security approach.

What is Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)?
A Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) enables one party, the prover (P), to convince another party, the verifier (V), that a statement is true without disclosing any information beyond the statement‚Äôs validity. This property makes ZKPs ideal for applications requiring both privacy and verifiability, such as identity management in decentralized environments.

A ZKP must satisfy three core properties:

Completeness: If the statement is true, an honest prover will convince an honest verifier with certainty (probability 1).

Soundness: If the statement is false, no cheating prover can convince the verifier, except with a negligible probability (denoted as 
Œµ
Œµ).

Zero-Knowledge: If the statement is true, the verifier learns nothing beyond the fact of its truth, preserving the prover‚Äôs privacy.

Mathematically, a ZKP protocol is defined by a tuple 
(
P
,
V
,
S
)
(P,V,S), where:

P
P (Prover): Holds private knowledge, the witness (
w
w), to prove a public statement (
x
x).

V
V (Verifier): Interacts with 
P
P to validate the proof without gaining insight into 
w
w.

S
S (Simulator): A polynomial-time algorithm that generates a transcript indistinguishable from the real 
P
‚àí
V
P‚àíV interaction without access to 
w
w, ensuring the zero-knowledge property.

The standard interactive ZKP protocol follows these steps:

Commitment: 
P
P generates a commitment to a random value and sends it to 
V
V, concealing 
w
w.

Challenge: 
V
V responds with a random challenge to test 
P
P's knowledge.

Response: 
P
P provides a response demonstrating knowledge of 
w
w without revealing it.

Verification: 
V
V checks the response against the commitment and challenge to confirm validity.

P

Conclusion
By integrating Proof of Personhood, InterLink ID establishes a fair and democratic framework where each human participant is assured equal representation and influence. This approach not only fortifies the network against identity-based attacks but also upholds the principles of decentralization and individual sovereignty.
Proof of Concept
Humanization In AI
A decentralized identity and AI training solution designed to ensure security, privacy, and trust in the digital world.

InterLink AI is a decentralized identity and artificial intelligence (AI) training platform designed to uphold security, privacy, and trust in digital environments. By leveraging Unique Data Training and Federated Learning, it facilitates the development of high-quality AI models while ensuring that user data remains securely stored on local devices rather than centralized servers.

The platform integrates non-identifiable biometric data from publicly available datasets, strategic partnerships, and governmental sources, enabling both real-time and batch AI processing with a high degree of accuracy. Security is reinforced through hashed biometric pools, zero-knowledge mapping, and trust scoring mechanisms, ensuring robust identity verification while preventing unauthorized access.

InterLink AI enables on-device AI model fine-tuning, preserving data privacy while allowing continuous learning and adaptation. These models are deployed through scalable, serverless architectures to support AI-driven automation and intelligent interactions. Built on high-performance infrastructure, including NVIDIA H100 GPUs and advanced decentralized storage solutions, InterLink AI ensures efficient, scalable processing while adhering to industry standards established by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

Unique Data Training
AI model accuracy is often compromised by data contamination, where excessive duplicate and bot-generated inputs degrade learning quality. Conventional AI training methods rely on large-scale, centralized data collection, making them vulnerable to biases, redundancies, and security risks. Unique Data Training addresses these challenges by ensuring that AI models learn exclusively from real, verified human contributors.


Key Mechanisms of Unique Data Training

Human-Verified Data Collection: To prevent bot interference and duplicate data submissions, a proof-of-personhood mechanism is implemented. Each participant undergoes identity verification before contributing data, guaranteeing dataset authenticity and uniqueness. This validation process mitigates the risk of synthetic or fraudulent inputs that could otherwise distort model learning.

Decentralized Data Framework: Unlike traditional centralized storage methods, which pose privacy and security concerns, Unique Data Training operates within a decentralized infrastructure. This approach enables secure, private, and high-quality data acquisition while preserving individual data sovereignty. AI models train on locally stored datasets without direct exposure to centralized repositories, reducing risks associated with data breaches.

Peer-to-Peer Model Refinement: To further enhance learning efficiency, verified contributors can engage in peer-to-peer data sharing, allowing AI models to adapt to diverse datasets without relying on a single controlling authority. This fosters a more resilient and unbiased AI ecosystem, improving model robustness across different use cases.

Improved Decision Accuracy and Ethical AI Development: By ensuring AI models are trained on unique and bot-free data, the resulting algorithms achieve higher decision accuracy and greater reliability. This structured approach eliminates biases, enhances transparency, and promotes ethical AI development, fostering a sustainable data-sharing ecosystem where contributors are incentivized through structured rewards.

Decentralized Federated Learning AI
Decentralized Federated Learning AI represents a transformative approach to machine learning, enabling AI models to be trained directly on user devices without transmitting raw data to centralized servers. This decentralized methodology enhances privacy, security, and efficiency by ensuring that data remains localized while still contributing to collective model improvements. Each device independently trains the AI model using its unique dataset, generating model updates rather than exposing personal information.


Local Training on Devices: Each participating device, including smartphones, tablets, and laptops, independently trains an AI model using locally stored data. This approach ensures that sensitive user information remains on-device, eliminating the need for centralized data collection while still enabling model improvements across the broader AI ecosystem.

Model Distribution: A baseline AI model is initially deployed from a central or distributed node to participating devices, establishing a standardized foundation for localized learning. As users interact with their devices, the model undergoes continuous refinement using real-time, device-specific data. This process preserves data privacy while simultaneously enhancing model performance and personalization.

Peer-to-Peer Model Sharing: To enhance the efficiency and robustness of the training process, devices can exchange model updates directly with nearby nodes in a peer-to-peer manner. This decentralized sharing mechanism reduces dependence on a central authority, fosters collaborative learning, and improves adaptation to diverse data distributions.

Model Updated Distribution: Instead of transmitting raw data, devices generate encrypted model updates, such as weight adjustments, which are securely aggregated. The improved global model is then redistributed to participating devices, ensuring continuous AI advancement while maintaining strict data sovereignty and compliance with privacy standards.

How It Works

The process begins when a user enters the system and undergoes InterLink ID Generation in InterLink App. During this stage, the user scans their face, and the system employs AI deepfake checking, biometric hashing, and proof of personhood techniques to verify their identity. This ensures that each individual is assigned a singular, non-duplicable InterLink ID, guaranteeing both uniqueness and humaness. As a result, every verified user becomes a Unique Human, collectively forming the Human Network. This decentralized network is designed to eliminate duplicate data and prevent bot infiltration, ensuring that AI training data remains authentic and reliable.

On the AI development side, AI model organizations and developers initiate the training process by sending training requests. These requests are distributed within the Human Network, where verified users complete designated training tasks. This Unique Data Training guarantees that the data used for AI model improvement originates exclusively from real humans, enhancing both accuracy and fairness in AI development.

The training itself is conducted directly on human devices, leveraging decentralized computation. Federated Learning AI enables devices within the network to share computational resources for advanced training. This approach allows AI models to be refined locally on user devices without raw data being transmitted to central servers. Instead, only aggregated updates from the trained models are returned to the AI model organizations and developers. This decentralized and privacy-preserving framework not only strengthens data security but also ensures that AI models are trained on diverse, high-quality human-generated data, fostering ethical and transparent AI development.

Decentralized Tokens For Human
Distribute token for all human in the world Fair... No Whales, Bot, Machine,...

InterLink ID Technology envisions a world where every human is seamlessly integrated into a decentralized digital ecosystem through a unique, universally distributed token. By ensuring that tokens are allocated fairly to all individuals‚Äîfree from manipulation by bots, machines, or disproportionate accumulators (‚Äúwhales‚Äù)‚ÄîInterLink ID redefines equitable access to digital identity, value, and opportunity. This section outlines the proof of concept for achieving this ambitious goal, detailing the mechanisms, safeguards, and innovations that make universal token distribution both feasible and transformative.

Core Principles of Fair Distribution
Fairness is the cornerstone of InterLink ID‚Äôs token distribution model. By leveraging our proprietary decentralized identity protocol, we ensure that only verified humans receive tokens, explicitly excluding bots, machines, or automated systems. To prevent the emergence of ‚Äúwhales,‚Äù tokens are issued on a one-per-person basis, with mechanisms to deter speculative accumulation. This approach guarantees that the system remains equitable, aligning with our mission to empower every individual globally.

The distribution is guided by several key principles:

Universality: Every human, regardless of geography, socioeconomic status, or technical access, is eligible for one token.

Fairness: Equal distribution and non-transferability prevent concentration of tokens among large holders.

Human-Centricity: Robust identity verification tied to InterLink ID‚Äôs decentralized identity framework excludes non-human entities.

Transparency: Blockchain technology ensures the distribution process is auditable and verifiable by all stakeholders.

Accessibility: Offline distribution channels and simplified onboarding address barriers like lack of internet access or technical literacy.

Technical Framework for Token Distribution
InterLink ID‚Äôs token distribution is powered by a suite of smart contracts deployed on a scalable blockchain. Upon successful identity verification through our decentralized ID protocol, a smart contract mints a single token to the user‚Äôs wallet. To prevent fraud, we integrate zero-knowledge proofs, ensuring privacy while confirming human identity. For scalability, we employ a layer-2 solution to process millions of transactions efficiently, with phased rollouts targeting 100 million users in the first year.

The token is designed as a non-fungible token (NFT) tied to each individual‚Äôs unique identity, ensuring it cannot be transferred or duplicated. Distribution leverages InterLink ID‚Äôs decentralized identity system, which authenticates humans via biometrics, government-issued IDs, or community attestation. Anti-fraud measures include AI-driven anomaly detection to flag bot activity or duplicate identities, and cryptographic commitments to verify identity without compromising privacy.

Addressing Challenges and Mitigations
A key challenge in universal token distribution is preventing Sybil attacks, where malicious actors create multiple identities to claim extra tokens. InterLink ID counters this through a multi-layered verification process, combining biometric authentication with community-based attestation for regions lacking formal IDs. Pilot tests demonstrated a 99.8% success rate in filtering out non-human or duplicate claims, validating the robustness of our approach.

Other challenges include:

Whale Accumulation: Mitigated by non-transferable tokens and governance rules limiting secondary market trading.

Digital Divide: Addressed through offline distribution channels (e.g., mobile vans, community centers) and simplified onboarding via SMS or USSD for feature phones.

Regulatory Compliance: Engagement with regulators ensures tokens comply with KYC/AML laws while preserving decentralization.

Scalability: Optimized blockchain throughput and hybrid on-chain/off-chain models handle billions of users.

Use Cases and Impact
InterLink ID‚Äôs tokens unlock a range of transformative use cases:

Identity and Access: Tokens serve as a decentralized ID, granting access to digital services like voting, banking, and education.

Economic Inclusion: Tokens enable participation in a global digital economy, especially for the unbanked. For example, tokens enabled 10,000 farmers to access microloans.

Governance: Tokens empower users to vote in decentralized governance systems, ensuring equitable decision-making.

Social Good: Tokens can be used for universal basic income, humanitarian aid, or carbon credit systems.

The impact is profound: projected to onboard 1 billion users by 2030, reducing financial exclusion by 20%.

The ‚ÄúDecentralized Tokens for Human‚Äù initiative represents a bold step toward a fairer, more inclusive digital future. By distributing tokens to every human while safeguarding against manipulation, InterLink ID Technology proves that universal access is not only possible but actionable. As we move to the next phase of our proof of concept, we invite partners, communities, and innovators to join us in building a decentralized ecosystem where every individual has a voice and a stake.

Deepfake Detection and Facial Recognition
In an era where digital identity fraud is escalating, InterLink ID introduces a groundbreaking AI-driven liveness detection and deepfake resistance system. Deepfakes‚ÄîAI-generated videos or images mimicking real people‚Äîthreaten security, with misuse ranging from financial fraud to disinformation. A 2023 Deeptrace report notes that deepfake content online doubles every six months, underscoring the need for advanced countermeasures. This section details how InterLink ID authenticates users while resisting such threats.

Core Technology: Facial Recognition Stack

Our facial recognition system is built on cutting-edge deep learning models, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs). These models, such as variants of XceptionNet and EfficientNet, are trained on extensive datasets comprising both authentic and synthetic facial images. This training enables the system to pinpoint the subtle visual cues ‚Äî like unnatural skin textures or irregular blinking ‚Äî that signal a deepfake. For a sequence of facial frames

f(X;Œ∏) assesses authenticity by calculating:

Œ∏
)
)
P(authentic‚à£X)=œÉ(f(X;Œ∏))
Here, 
œÉ
œÉ is the sigmoid function, delivering a probability score between 0 (synthetic) and 1 (authentic).

Detecting Deepfakes: A Multi-Layered Approach

Deepfakes often betray themselves through inconsistencies in motion or appearance. Our system employs both spatial analysis (examining individual images) and temporal analysis (tracking motion across frames). For instance, we use an optical flow function, 
Œ¶
(
R
t
,
R
t
+

)
Œ¶(R 
t
‚Äã

 ), to measure movement consistency between consecutive facial regions of interest (ROIs):

Lower coherence in motion often indicates a synthetic sequence, as generative models struggle to replicate natural dynamics perfectly.

Additionally, we apply spectral analysis to uncover frequency-domain artifacts typical of AI-generated content. By computing the Fourier transform of an image signal, 
X
^
=
F
(
X
)
X

 =F(X), we detect irregular frequency patterns that distinguish deepfakes from genuine footage. The model refines its accuracy by minimizing a binary cross-entropy loss:

Liveness Detection: Verifying Real-Time Presence

To counter attacks using static images or pre-recorded videos, InterLink ID integrates liveness detection. This system analyzes real-time physiological signals‚Äîsuch as eye movements, micro-expressions, or subtle skin texture shifts‚Äîrequiring users to perform actions like blinking or smiling. This ensures the subject is physically present, adding an extra layer of security.


Figure 1: Deepfake detection and liveness verification process in InterLink ID.
Privacy and Ethical Design

Facial recognition raises privacy concerns, which InterLink ID addresses proactively. Biometric data is processed locally on users‚Äô devices, with only encrypted, anonymized features sent for verification. This minimizes breach risks and aligns with regulations like GDPR and CCPA, ensuring trust and compliance.

Performance Metrics and Robustness

In controlled evaluations, our CNN-based deepfake detection model achieved an accuracy exceeding 90% on challenging benchmark datasets, surpassing the 89% reported for XceptionNet in similar settings. Additionally, our system incorporates federated learning mechanisms, enabling continuous refinement of model parameters based on adversarial attempts encountered in production. Let

where

L represents the loss function. This approach ensures resilience against emerging deepfake generation techniques.

To enhance adversarial robustness, we integrate an ensemble of spatial CNNs and temporal analysis models with cross-modal verification mechanisms. Attackers attempting to spoof the system must circumvent multiple layers of security, including facial recognition, liveness detection, and artifact analysis. This multi-faceted defense significantly raises the computational and technical barriers for malicious actors, surpassing traditional video-call or selfie-based verifications. Additionally, cryptographic integrity verification safeguards the biometric enrollment process, ensuring that only audited AI models contribute to identity verification.

While no biometric authentication system is entirely impervious to adversarial attacks, InterLink ID significantly elevates the cost and complexity of identity spoofing, offering a robust, scalable, and high-fidelity facial authentication framework.
Technical Implementation
Encrypted Biometric Data
Traditional biometric authentication systems store raw biometric data‚Äîsuch as fingerprints, facial images, or voice samples‚Äîdirectly in centralized databases, creating significant privacy and security vulnerabilities. A single breach could expose sensitive user information, and the centralized nature of these systems makes them prime targets for attackers. Additionally, such approaches often struggle to comply with stringent privacy regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). InterLink ID revolutionizes this paradigm by employing zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) and homomorphic encryption to transform biometric features into irreversible, encrypted representations. This enables secure, decentralized identity verification without ever storing or exposing raw biometric data, striking a balance between uniqueness (each individual has a distinct encrypted identity) and privacy (no sensitive information is revealed).

Here‚Äôs a detailed breakdown of the privacy-preserving biometric encryption process in InterLink ID:

Feature Extraction: The process begins with extracting distinctive features from a biometric input, such as a facial image, fingerprint, or iris scan. InterLink ID uses advanced deep learning models‚Äîsuch as ResNet or Vision Transformers (ViT)‚Äîpre-trained on large datasets to map the raw biometric data 
B
B into a high-dimensional feature vector 
F
F:

F
=
f
(
B
)
‚àà
R
d
F=f(B)‚ààR 
d
 
where 
d
d represents the dimensionality of the feature space, and 
f
(
‚ãÖ
)
f(‚ãÖ) is the deep learning-based feature extractor. These models excel at capturing robust, unique characteristics, making them ideal for reliable identity verification.

Quantization and Secure Transformation: To enhance privacy and security, the feature vector 
F
F undergoes a series of transformations:

Biometric Salting and Random Projection Hashing: A randomized orthogonal transformation T T T is applied to decorrelate the feature components, preventing attackers from reconstructing the original features:

F
‚Ä≤
=
T
F
F 
‚Ä≤
 =TF
where 
T
T is a randomly generated orthogonal matrix.

Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH): The transformed vector 
F
‚Ä≤
F 
‚Ä≤
  is then mapped to a fixed-length binary hash using an LSH function:

H
(
F
‚Ä≤
)
=
(
h

,
h

)
H(F 
‚Ä≤
 )=(h

‚Äã
 ,h

‚Äã
 ,...,h 
m
‚Äã
 ),h 
i
‚Äã
 =sign(w 
i
T
‚Äã
 F 
‚Ä≤
 +b 
i
‚Äã
 )
where 
w
i
w 
i
‚Äã
  are random projection vectors, and 
b
i
b 
i
‚Äã
  are bias terms. LSH ensures that similar biometric inputs produce similar hashes, enabling approximate matching while obscuring exact feature values.

Zero-knowledge Biometric Encryption: Rather than storing the biometric hash 
H
(
F
‚Ä≤
)
H(F 
‚Ä≤
 ) directly, InterLink ID employs a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP)-based commitment scheme using a Pedersen commitment:

C
=
g
H
(
F
‚Ä≤
)
h
r
mod 
p
C=g 
H(F 
‚Ä≤
 )
 h 
r
 mod p
where 
g
g and 
h
h are generators of a cyclic group, 
r
r is a random blinding factor, andis a large prime number. This commitment allows the system to store a representation of the biometric hash without revealing it, ensuring that even if the stored data is accessed, the original biometric information remains protected.

Decentralized Verification: The commitment 
C
C is stored in the Decentralized InterLink ZK Biometric Node Pool, a distributed ledger-based trust pool. During authentication, the user (prover) generates a zero-knowledge proof of knowledge (ZKPoK) to demonstrate that their biometric hash matches the stored commitment 
C
C without disclosing 
H
(
F
‚Ä≤
)
H(F 
‚Ä≤
 ). The decentralized node pool collectively verifies this proof, ensuring a secure and privacy-preserving authentication process with no centralized point of failure.

AI-Powered Encryption Enhancements: InterLink ID integrates state-of-the-art AI techniques to bolster the encryption process:

Self-Supervised Learning (SSL): Models like SimCLR and BYOL extract robust feature representations without labeled data, reducing overfitting and enhancing resilience against adversarial attacks.

Differential Privacy (DP): Noise is injected into the biometric features before hashing, preventing reconstruction of the original input even if an attacker accesses the hashed data.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): Synthetic biometric data generated by GANs is used to test the system‚Äôs robustness against spoofing, ensuring it can distinguish genuine inputs from fabricated ones.

Security and Privacy Guarantees: This approach delivers several key benefits:

Irreversibility: The multi-step transformation and encryption process makes it computationally infeasible to recover the original biometric data.

Cancelability: If a biometric encryption is compromised, a new transformation matrix 
T
T can be issued, allowing users to re-enroll without altering their underlying biometrics.

Decentralization: Distributed storage and verification eliminate single points of failure, enhancing system resilience.

Compliance with Privacy Regulation: InterLink ID‚Äôs design inherently aligns with global privacy regulations, such as GDPR and CCPA. By never storing raw biometric data and using zero-knowledge proofs for verification, the system minimizes the risk of unauthorized data exposure, a key requirement under GDPR‚Äôs data minimization principle. The decentralized architecture ensures transparency and accountability, allowing users to maintain control over their personal information as mandated by CCPA. This compliance not only mitigates legal risks but also builds trust with users and stakeholders in privacy-sensitive markets.

Real-World Applications: InterLink ID‚Äôs privacy-preserving biometric encryption has broad applicability across industries. In finance, it enables secure customer onboarding and transaction authentication without exposing biometric data, reducing fraud risks. In healthcare, it protects patient identities during telemedicine or electronic health record access, ensuring compliance with HIPAA alongside GDPR. For government services, it facilitates secure voter verification or border control, balancing security with citizen privacy. These applications highlight the versatility and real-world impact of InterLink ID‚Äôs technology.

Innovation in Biometric Security: Unlike traditional biometric systems that rely on centralized storage and direct template matching, InterLink ID integrates zero-knowledge proofs with AI-driven feature extraction to achieve unparalleled privacy and security. Conventional methods expose raw data during breaches and lack cancelability, whereas InterLink ID‚Äôs encrypted, decentralized approach ensures data remains protected and renewable. This fusion of cryptography and artificial intelligence sets a new benchmark for biometric authentication, addressing longstanding privacy challenges in digital identity management.

Future-Proofing the System: InterLink ID is engineered to evolve with emerging threats and technological advancements. The modular use of AI models allows for seamless integration of next-generation feature extractors, such as improved Vision Transformers or quantum-resistant neural networks. Similarly, the cryptographic framework supports updates to zero-knowledge protocols as quantum computing advances, ensuring long-term security. This adaptability positions InterLink ID as a resilient solution for the future of digital identity verification.


Figure 1: Privacy-Preserving Biometric Encryption in InterLink ID.
The privacy-preserving biometric encryption technique in InterLink ID presents a groundbreaking approach to secure identity verification. By combining it with federated learning, InterLink ID strikes a balance between uniqueness (each human has one encrypted representation) and privacy (no raw biometric data exposed).
Technical Implementation
Zero-Knowledge Proofs
Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) are a transformative cryptographic technique that underpin InterLink ID Technology‚Äôs approach to privacy-preserving identity verification in the Web3 ecosystem. This section explores the fundamentals of ZKPs, their applications in blockchain and decentralized systems, and how InterLink ID leverages this technology to deliver secure, trustless authentication while addressing implementation challenges and future opportunities.

What is Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)?
A Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) enables one party, the prover (P), to convince another party, the verifier (V), that a statement is true without disclosing any information beyond the statement‚Äôs validity. This property makes ZKPs ideal for applications requiring both privacy and verifiability, such as identity management in decentralized environments.

A ZKP must satisfy three core properties:

Completeness: If the statement is true, an honest prover will convince an honest verifier with certainty (probability 1).

Soundness: If the statement is false, no cheating prover can convince the verifier, except with a negligible probability (denoted as 
Œµ
Œµ).

Zero-Knowledge: If the statement is true, the verifier learns nothing beyond the fact of its truth, preserving the prover‚Äôs privacy.

Mathematically, a ZKP protocol is defined by a tuple 
(
P
,
V
,
S
)
(P,V,S), where:

P
P (Prover): Holds private knowledge, the witness (
w
w), to prove a public statement (
x
x).

V
V (Verifier): Interacts with 
P
P to validate the proof without gaining insight into 
w
w.

S
S (Simulator): A polynomial-time algorithm that generates a transcript indistinguishable from the real 
P
‚àí
V
P‚àíV interaction without access to 
w
w, ensuring the zero-knowledge property.

The standard interactive ZKP protocol follows these steps:

Commitment: 
P
P generates a commitment to a random value and sends it to 
V
V, concealing 
w
w.

Challenge: 
V
V responds with a random challenge to test 
P
P's knowledge.

Response: 
P
P provides a response demonstrating knowledge of 
w
w without revealing it.

Verification: 
V
V checks the response against the commitment and challenge to confirm validity.

P

Applications of ZKP in Web3 and Blockchain
ZKPs enhance privacy, security, and scalability across Web3 and blockchain ecosystems. InterLink ID harnesses these capabilities to provide trustless identity verification and privacy-preserving authentication, ensuring users retain sovereignty over their data. Below are key applications, with specific ties to InterLink ID‚Äôs implementation.

Privacy-Preserving Identity Verification

InterLink ID employs ZKPs to allow users to prove identity attributes without exposing sensitive details. For example, a user can demonstrate they are over 18‚Äîsatisfying age-restricted access‚Äîwithout revealing their birth date. As shown in Figure 1, the prover commits to a random value tied to their attribute, enabling verification while preserving privacy.

zk-SNARKs and zk-STARKs in Blockchain

zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge): These enable compact, efficient proofs for private transactions, as seen in Zcash, where transaction details are shielded. InterLink ID could use zk-SNARKs to validate identity proofs succinctly on-chain.

zk-STARKs (Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge): These improve on zk-SNARKs by eliminating trusted setups and offering post-quantum security. In Ethereum‚Äôs zk-Rollups, zk-STARKs verify off-chain computations on-chain, a model InterLink ID leverages for scalable identity validation (see Figure 1‚Äôs optimized Verify step).

Decentralized Authentication: ZKPs enable passwordless authentication, enhancing security by proving credential knowledge without transmission. For instance, the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) could use ZKPs to verify domain ownership without exposing private keys, a technique InterLink ID adapts for seamless user authentication.

Proof-of-Reserves in DeFi: In decentralized finance (DeFi), ZKPs prove asset holdings without disclosing wallet addresses or balances. Exchanges like Binance and Kraken use ZKP-based audits for transparency, a concept InterLink ID could extend to verify institutional identity claims anonymously.

Secure Voting and DAO Governance: ZKPs ensure private, transparent voting in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). A member proves eligibility without revealing their identity or vote, a mechanism InterLink ID could integrate into governance-related identity solutions.

InterLink ID‚Äôs Implementation of ZKPs:

InterLink ID integrates ZKPs into its identity framework as follows:

User Registration: Users generate ZKPs for identity attributes (e.g., age, nationality) using private data, storing only the proof commitment.

Verification Request: When a service requires verification (e.g., age for access), the user submits a ZKP proving the attribute.

On-Chain Verification: The blockchain validates the proof, ensuring authenticity without exposing the underlying data.

This process, aligned with Figure 1, ensures privacy and decentralization, key tenets of InterLink ID‚Äôs mission.

Challenges and Solutions: 

Implementing ZKPs presents challenges that InterLink ID addresses strategically:

Computational Overhead: Proof generation and verification can be resource-intensive. InterLink ID optimizes this using efficient systems like zk-STARKs, reducing latency in the Commitment and Response phases (see Figure 1).

Trusted Setup: zk-SNARKs require a trusted setup, posing security risks. InterLink ID prefers zk-STARKs, which avoid this dependency, enhancing transparency.

User Experience: Complex protocols may deter adoption. InterLink ID streamlines ZKP integration into user workflows, ensuring accessibility without sacrificing security.

Future Directions for ZKPs in InterLink ID:

InterLink ID is poised to advance ZKP technology to meet evolving Web3 demands:

Post-Quantum Security: Researching quantum-resistant ZKPs to safeguard against future threats, ensuring long-term viability.

Scalability Enhancements: Reducing proof size and verification time to support real-time identity applications, building on Figure 1‚Äôs framework.

Integration with Emerging Primitives: Combining ZKPs with homomorphic encryption or multi-party computation for advanced privacy-preserving solutions, such as collaborative identity verification.

Zero-Knowledge Proofs are a foundational cryptographic technique that enhances privacy, security, and scalability in Web3 applications. InterLink ID Technology utilizes ZKPs to enable secure and trustworthy identity verification and privacy-preserving authentication, ensuring users maintain control over their personal information in a decentralized ecosystem.

Technical Implementation
Federated Learning

Figure 1: Federated learning architecture showing how InterLink Network trains AI models across distributed devices while preserving user privacy. Model updates are aggregated centrally while raw biometric data never leaves user devices.
Training Phase
InterLink Network employs federated learning (FL) to train its AI models (e.g., deepfake detection, fraud detection, etc.) across thousands of user devices and nodes without exposing raw biometric data. As a next-generation digital identity platform designed for the decentralized era, InterLink ID provides a secure and private method to verify one's unique human identity, acting as a universal passport in the digital world. Unlike conventional federated learning systems, InterLink first establishes user uniqueness through its proprietary hashing technology, assigning each enrolled user a distinct cryptographic identity within the Network. InterLink ID also converts biometric data provided by users into secure, irreversible embeddings for federated training, ensuring privacy and security while enabling collaborative model improvement.

By using biometrics (a face scan) instead of passwords or documents, InterLink ID dramatically improves both security and convenience. Users can prove "I am a real person and I am unique" without sharing sensitive personal details each time. In a federated round, each client (user's device or a node) computes updates to the global model using only these secure irreversible high-dimensional embeddings of the provided user data, and only model updates (e.g., gradients or weight deltas) are sent to the aggregator (server), never the raw biometric data. The server then performs a weighted averaging of the updates to improve the global model. Formally, if 
F

which is a gradient descent step combining all clients' contributions. Through this process, the AI model improves collectively: for example, learning to better distinguish between real transactions and fraudulent ones as more clients enroll in the system, without compromising individual biometric data. Federated learning comes with theoretical convergence guarantees under certain conditions, and techniques like secure aggregation and differential privacy can be layered in to ensure no single participant's data can be reconstructed from model updates.

Techniques such as model pruning and model quantization reduce computational overhead, allowing even resource-constrained mobile devices to participate with minimal latency or power consumption. Users can opt-in to contribute resources during idle periods (e.g., while charging or on Wi-Fi), earning token rewards proportional to their computational effort. On-chain checkpoints, recorded via blockchain, enhance transparency and fault tolerance. This distributed computing framework not only boosts model accuracy over time but also eliminates centralized data vulnerabilities, aligning with InterLink ID's decentralized ethos.

Backup Mechanism for Intermediate Nodes: To ensure resilience, InterLink ID implements a robust backup mechanism for intermediate nodes that store encrypted biometric embeddings. As depicted in Figure 1, these nodes operate as a distributed layer between clients and the aggregator, enhancing security and continuity. The mechanism includes:

Redundant Storage: Encrypted embeddings are replicated across multiple nodes, providing fault tolerance.

Real-time Monitoring: Continuous health and security checks detect anomalies or failures in real time.

Automatic Failover: Upon detecting an attack or node failure, the system activates backup storage, seamlessly restoring encrypted data with minimal disruption.

Data Integrity Checks: Cryptographic hash functions (e.g., SHA-256) verify the consistency and authenticity of stored embeddings, ensuring resilience against tampering.

This architecture, illustrated in Figure 1, ensures that the federated learning process remains operational and secure, even under adversarial conditions, preserving both data integrity and user privacy.

Inference Phase
The inference phase in a federated learning system is crucial for deploying the trained model to make predictions on new data while maintaining the privacy and security principles established during training. In the context of InterLink ID, the inference phase involves using the globally trained model to verify user identities without exposing sensitive biometric data.

Inference Process:

Local Data Processing: When a user attempts to authenticate, their biometric data (e.g., a face scan) is processed locally on their device. Let 
B
B represent the raw biometric data. The biometric data is converted into secure, irreversible embeddings 
E
E using the same feature extraction and hashing techniques employed during training: 
E
=
f
(
B
)
E=f(B) where 
f
f is the feature extraction function.

Local Model Application: The locally processed embeddings 
E
E are then fed into the globally trained model 
M
M, which resides on the user's device. This model has been updated through federated learning rounds and contains the collective knowledge from all participating devices:   
P
=
M
(
E
)
P=M(E) where 
P
P is the prediction output.

Prediction Generation: The model generates a prediction 
P
P based on the local embeddings. For identity verification, this prediction could be a probability score 
p
p indicating the likelihood that the user is who they claim to be: 
p
=
œÉ
(
P
)
p=œÉ(P) where 
œÉ
œÉ is the sigmoid activation function.

Secure Communication: If necessary, the prediction 
p
p or a summary of the inference results can be securely communicated to a central server or a decentralized network for further validation. However, the raw biometric data 
B
B and embeddings 
E
E remain on the user's device, ensuring privacy.

Decision Making: Based on the prediction 
p
p, the system makes a decision regarding the user's authentication request. This decision can be made locally or in conjunction with additional verification steps performed by the central server or decentralized network.

Advantages of Federated Inference:

Privacy Preservation: By keeping the raw biometric data 
B
B and embeddings 
E
E on the user's device, the inference phase maintains the privacy and security principles of federated learning.

Reduced Latency: Local inference reduces the need for constant communication with a central server, resulting in faster authentication times.

Scalability: The decentralized nature of federated inference allows the system to scale efficiently, handling a large number of authentication requests without overloading a central server.

Robustness: The use of a globally trained model 
M
M ensures that the system benefits from the collective knowledge of all participating devices, improving the accuracy and robustness of predictions.

Example Workflow:

User Authentication Request: A user initiates an authentication request by providing a biometric input 
B
B (e.g., a face scan).

Local Processing: The user's device processes the biometric input 
B
B, converting it into secure embeddings 
E
E: 
E
=
f
(
B
)
E=f(B)

Local Inference: The locally stored model 
M
M generates a prediction 
P
P based on the embeddings 
E
E: 
P
=
M
(
E
)
P=M(E)

Secure Validation: If needed, the prediction 
p
=
œÉ
(
P
)
p=œÉ(P) is securely communicated to a central server or decentralized network for additional validation.

Authentication Decision: The system makes a final decision on the authentication request, granting or denying access based on the prediction 
p
p.

By integrating federated learning into both the training and inference phases, InterLink ID ensures a secure, private, and efficient identity verification process that aligns with the principles of decentralization and user control.

Integration with Proprietary Technology: InterLink ID‚Äôs federated learning leverages its proprietary hashing technology to create cryptographic identities and secure embeddings. Each user‚Äôs biometric data is salted and hashed into a unique identifier, enabling precise tracking of contributions without revealing personal details. During training, embeddings are generated via a hybrid CNN-hashing pipeline, ensuring compatibility with the global model while thwarting reverse-engineering attempts. This integration enhances both privacy and the system‚Äôs ability to scale across diverse populations.

Performance Evaluation: InterLink ID‚Äôs federated learning system achieves a False Acceptance Rate (FAR) below 0.001 and a False Rejection Rate (FRR) below 0.005, validated across 10,000 devices. Compared to centralized models, it offers a 20% improvement in fraud detection accuracy due to its diverse training data. Inference latency averages 450 ms on mid-range smartphones, with energy consumption reduced by 30% through optimization techniques, ensuring accessibility and efficiency.

  is training time. Users opt-in via a transparent interface, controlling when their device trains (e.g., overnight). This incentivized model has boosted participation rates by 40%, creating a self-sustaining network that enhances model accuracy over time.

Future Directions: InterLink ID aims to enhance federated learning with homomorphic encryption, enabling computations on encrypted updates for added privacy. Plans also include integrating secure multi-party computation (SMPC) to further decentralize aggregation, reducing reliance on a central server. These advancements will position InterLink ID as a leader in privacy-preserving AI, adapting to emerging threats like quantum attacks.
InterLink Tokenomics
Introducing
InterLink Token is the native digital asset of the InterLink Network ‚Äî designed to become the most widely distributed and human-owned token in the world.

Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies ‚Äî and even Bitcoin, which favors those with early capital or mining hardware ‚Äî InterLink Token is earned exclusively by real, verified humans through proof of personhood. One person, one node, one opportunity to participate. No rigs, no bots, no manipulation.

Where Bitcoin proves computational power, InterLink Token proves humanity.

With a vision to onboard 1 billion real people, InterLink aims to become the most decentralized cryptocurrency in terms of human distribution ‚Äî powering governance, applications, and the on-chain reputation economy.

FAQ
When will the token be listed on an exchange? What will the TGE (Token Generation Event) look like?

The current plan is to list the token toward the end of 2025 or early 2026. However, now that we have the InterLink DAO, all major decisions will be made transparently with the community.

It‚Äôs important to remember that listing too early may not be ideal if the project hasn‚Äôt reached a mature and ready state ‚Äî and listing too late may also carry opportunity costs. Therefore, the final decision will be made through a vote by $ITLG holders.

For the TGE, the system will calculate the token unlock schedule based on a linear relationship with the number of tokens held ‚Äî with a maximum vesting period of up to 180 months. The more tokens one holds, the longer the lock-up period, ensuring price stability and sustainable growth of the ecosystem.

Will the token face excessive inflation? Are there still more halving events planned?

The token will be burned and used as a medium of exchange throughout the entire ecosystem. Additionally, we‚Äôve completely eliminated bots and farmers from the system, making exploitation by mining farms or automation virtually impossible.

Halving events will continue ‚Äî potentially up to 100 times ‚Äî to ensure a consistent reduction in emissions and long-term value preservation.

Does adopting a dual-token model with $ITL and $ITLG risk diluting overall value?

No ‚Äî the dual-token model was carefully designed to separate governance, utility, and strategic functions in a way that reinforces long-term value creation rather than diluting it.

$ITLG serves as the genesis token, earned exclusively through mining by verified humans. It governs the InterLink DAO and plays a critical role in expanding the human network ‚Äî including future use cases like enabling a decentralized payment layer across the ecosystem.

$ITL is the core utility and strategic token, structured for integration with ecosystem partners, institutions, and large-scale capital (e.g. funds and infrastructure players). It‚Äôs also the token InterLink will align with future public offerings or stock listings, offering a regulatory-friendly, institution-ready model.

By clearly distinguishing roles ‚Äî with $ITLG anchoring community growth and governance, and $ITL powering economic utility and external integration ‚Äî InterLink avoids value fragmentation and instead builds a dual-token architecture with complementary strengths that can scale across retail, institutional, and regulatory layers.

What will the $ITLG token price be at listing?

We have our own internal formula to determine a fair valuation, and it will be directly proportional to the number of users in the network.

Why was ITLG initially said to be 10 billion? Did you increase the supply due to user growth?

No. The total supply of InterLink Token ($ITL) has always been fixed at 10 billion, and this has never changed.

As for InterLink Genesis Token ($ITLG) ‚Äî the supply was also transparently shared from the beginning with partners, investors, and ecosystem stakeholders. This includes global names such as Google, AWS, NIST, and NYSE-aligned institutions, who were fully informed of the token model before committing to the InterLink vision.
Token Mining Mechanism and Sustainability
In the early stages of network growth, mining activities are intentionally designed to be accessible and straightforward. This approach encourages mass adoption, rapid user onboarding, and the strengthening of the human node network.

However, to ensure long-term sustainability and fairness, InterLink has implemented a dynamic mining mechanism that balances incentives between early participants and new entrants:

Balanced Reward Structure: The mining algorithm is designed so that new users are not left too far behind in token acquisition, while early adopters still maintain strong incentives to continue mining actively.

Anti-Bot Protection: With real human verification through InterLink ID, bot activities are fully mitigated, ensuring that only genuine users participate in mining rewards.

Token Locking Mechanism: A proportion of mined tokens is subject to strategic vesting and locking schedules. This maintains a healthy token supply-demand balance and prevents excessive immediate circulation.

Equitable Profit Opportunities: The mechanism ensures that both small and large token holders can achieve favorable returns without disproportionately affecting the overall token price.

While rapid mining activity is a common phenomenon during the initial expansion phases, InterLink‚Äôs architecture guarantees that token inflation is tightly controlled.

Through real human verification, vesting mechanisms, and a carefully calibrated reward model, InterLink preserves both token value and mining attractiveness over time ‚Äî fostering a healthy, self-sustaining ecosystem for all participants.

Mining accessibility today, sustainable value for tomorrow.

Introducing InterLink Coach House
It serves as a private space where growth, strategy, and leadership come together to guide the next generation of community builders.

The InterLink Coach House is the official leadership and mentorship hub for the InterLink Network. It is open to all Linkers who aspire to become Ambassadors, serving as the gateway from applicant to leader.

It replaces the old Ambassador Onboarding Program (T1, T2, T3) with a stronger, more transparent system that combines training, accountability, and direct mentorship.

Inside the Interlink Coach House:

Every Linker who wishes to become an Ambassador must first join the InterLink Coach House Onboarding.

Members report directly to the Global Partners (Coaches), who serve as mentors and evaluators.

The Coaches assess each applicant and decide if they qualify for Tier 3, Tier 2, or Tier 1 based on performance, referrals, and commitment.

Global Partners report daily to the Core Team, ensuring transparency and alignment with InterLink‚Äôs global vision.

Members gain exclusive access to training materials, strategies, leadership workshops, and growth systems.

The House fosters teamwork, creativity, and measurable impact through structured activities and accountability programs.

Security & Quality Controls
To maintain the integrity of the onboarding process:

An Anti-Raid system is active: if more than 15 people join within 15 minutes, further joins will be temporarily blocked. Those already in the group remain unaffected. This prevents spammers and unprofessional messages.

A 10-second slow mode is enforced to ensure that each member‚Äôs questions are properly addressed and everyone receives guidance without messages getting lost.

The Coach House is more than just a group‚Äîit is the proving ground for future leaders of Web3. Here, Linkers are trained, guided, and elevated to become Ambassadors who carry the InterLink vision forward.

House Rules on How to Become an Ambassador & Grow into a Better One

The InterLink Coach House is the official training ground and central hub for all InterLink Ambassadors and aspiring candidates.

Only those who show loyalty, consistency, and potential are invited to enter the Internal House.

For Official Ambassadors:

A professional environment where Ambassadors can grow, collaborate, and take on greater responsibilities.

Structure of the Coach House
House Rules on How to Become an Ambassador & Grow into a Better One

InterLink Ambassador Structures: Transition from Old to New
1. Old Ambassador Structure (Legacy System)
The old InterLink Ambassador framework was based on a three-tier hierarchy. Each tier reflected the member‚Äôs influence, responsibilities, and recognition within the ecosystem.

Tier 3 (T3) ‚Äì Influencer
Entry point into the Ambassador program.

Primarily focused on content sharing, visibility, and brand influence.

Role: Drive online awareness through social platforms.

Tier 2 (T2) ‚Äì Community Builder
Elevated role after demonstrating consistency.

Responsibilities included community moderation, local engagement, and grassroots events.

Role: Build and maintain healthy community spaces online and offline.

Tier 1 (T1) ‚Äì Global Leader
The highest level in the old ambassador system.

Represented InterLink on a global scale, often coordinating across multiple regions.

Responsibilities included strategic leadership, training lower tiers, and representing InterLink in external initiatives.

Limitations of the Old Structure:

No formal stage for applicants before becoming T3.

Growth path stopped at T1, leaving no higher-level mentorship layer.

Ambassadors had responsibilities but lacked centralized oversight and transparent allocation processes.

2. New InterLink Coach House Structure (Upgraded System)
The new InterLink Coach House introduces a tiered ecosystem that begins with applicants and extends to global leadership. It ensures every participant has a clear path for growth, responsibilities, and mentorship.

Linkers (Applicants)
Entry point into the House.

Join the Onboarding Group where referrals, activity, and contributions are evaluated.

Only those who demonstrate commitment progress to T3.

Tier 3 (T3) ‚Äì Influencer
Equivalent to ‚ÄúInfluencers‚Äù in the old structure.

Responsible for content creation, sharing, and boosting online visibility.

Focus: learning discipline and building influence.

Tier 2 (T2) ‚Äì Community Builder
Equivalent to ‚ÄúCommunity Builders‚Äù in the old structure.

Engage in group moderation, local activities, and event support.

Focus: community growth and leadership development.

Tier 1 (T1) ‚Äì Global Leader
Equivalent to ‚ÄúGlobal Leaders‚Äù in the old structure.

Lead larger communities, mentor lower tiers, and coordinate strategic initiatives.

Focus: leadership, accountability, and representation.

Global Partners (Coaches)
Coach Joel and Coach Luke serve as primary mentors and overseers.

Guide Ambassadors, manage allocations, and ensure transparency in ITLG reward distribution.

Act as bridges between Ambassadors and the Core Team.

Core Team
The highest governing body of the House.

Responsible for strategy, ecosystem development, and long-term sustainability.

Works with Global Partners to scale leadership and global impact.

3. Key Differences: Old vs New
Aspect
Old Structure
New Coach House Structure
Entry Point

Stopped at T1

Extended to Global Partners & Core Team

The old system established the foundation for influence, community building, and leadership through T3‚ÄìT2‚ÄìT1 roles. However, it lacked an applicant stage and higher-level oversight.

The new Coach House structure expands this framework by introducing Linkers (entry applicants) and elevating leadership with Global Partners and the Core Team. This ensures a complete growth journey:

From Linker ‚Üí Influencer ‚Üí Community Builder ‚Üí Global Leader ‚Üí Global Partner ‚Üí Core Team.

This new structure makes leadership progression transparent, intentional, and sustainable for long-term ecosystem growth.
Onboarding Process & Qualification
House Rules on How to Become an Ambassador & Grow into a Better One

The InterLink Coach House follows a structured onboarding process to ensure that only the most committed and capable individuals qualify as Ambassadors. This process is designed to evaluate applicants fairly and place them in the correct tier for growth and contribution.

Step 1: Enter the Onboarding Group
All applicants (Linkers) must first join the Onboarding Group.

Here, Coaches and senior Ambassadors will evaluate their referrals, community presence, and social activity.

This stage acts as the training ground where potential is tested before advancement.

Step 2: Evaluation Criteria
We evaluate each candidate based on several factors:

Network Growth ‚Äì Ability to bring in new, quality members into the ecosystem.

Content Creation ‚Äì Effectiveness in spreading InterLink through original and impactful content.

Commitment Level ‚Äì Demonstrated consistency, loyalty, and genuine interest in InterLink.

Community Presence ‚Äì Positive engagement both online and offline.

Step 3: Placement into Tiers
After evaluation, qualified applicants are placed into the Ambassador tiers:

Tier 3 Ambassadors ‚Äì Entry point for new Ambassadors.

Tier 2 Ambassadors ‚Äì For outstanding candidates who display strong potential.

Tier 1 Ambassadors ‚Äì Earned through careful observation and consistent performance over time.

Step 4: Entry into the Internal House
Once promoted, Ambassadors are given access to the Internal House.

This is the official hub for:

Training & mentorship

Task assignments (daily/monthly)

Reward distribution and announcements

Direct communication with Coaches

Evaluation & Tier Assignment
The process of assigning ambassadors to the correct tier will be handled with fairness, transparency, and accountability.

The process is as follows:

Candidates will reach out to either Coach Joel or Coach Luke, regardless on which country they come from.

Global Partners / Evaluators will carefully evaluate their performance, activities, and potential.

At the end of each day, Global Partners will send to the Core Team the evaluated list of candidates.

The Core Team will then update the official list and assign their badges in the InterLink App.

Authority of Assignment:

Applicants or Linkers together with Tier 3, and Tier 2: Global Partners have full authority to decide and assign candidates.

Tier 1 (Global Leader): Decisions for Tier 1 will always be discussed and finalized together with the Global Partners and The Core Team to ensure strong leadership alignment.

This ensures that every candidate is placed where they can thrive, grow, and contribute most effectively to InterLink‚Äôs mission.

Important Note

If country does not have Global Leader, even Community Partner, Global Partners will be the one who directly lead Tier 3.
Once the onboarding process is complete and all applicants are moved, old groups will be permanently closed to ensure all official activities are centralized in the InterLink Coach House.

Qualification as an Ambassador is not just about joining‚Äîit is about proving readiness to lead, contribute, and uphold the values of InterLink.

Global Partners Reward Scheme
House Rules on How to Become an Ambassador & Grow into a Better One

The Global Partners Program is a recognition and reward system designed for outstanding leaders who have consistently demonstrated loyalty, growth, and long-term commitment to the InterLink ecosystem. Unlike the Ambassador Rewards (which focus on content creation, referrals, and activity), the Global Partners Reward Scheme is built on partnership, leadership, and ecosystem impact.

1. Purpose of the Reward Scheme
To recognize top leaders who contribute to the long-term success of InterLink.

To ensure that Global Partners share in the growth of the InterLink ecosystem.

To maintain motivation, stability, and alignment among high-level leaders.

2. Reward Allocation
Coaches (Global Partners): Each Global Partner (e.g., Coach Joel & Coach Luke) receives a fixed allocation of 100,000 ITLG per cycle.

Ambassador Incentive Pool: A portion of the Coach allocations (20% = 40,000 ITLG) is redistributed to reward active and high-level Ambassadors.

Distribution Mechanism:

If 20 Ambassadors qualify (reaching Level 100+), then 40,000 ITLG √∑ 20 = 2,000 ITLG per Ambassador.

If fewer Ambassadors qualify, each receives a higher share of the 40,000 ITLG pool.

3. Halving Rewards & Market Volatility Adjustments
Halving Policy: Rewards may undergo scheduled halving events to ensure token sustainability, similar to Bitcoin‚Äôs model.

Market Adjustment Rule: If the price of ITLG increases significantly, rewards may be adjusted downward (halved or reduced) to maintain long-term balance.

Conversely, if the price of ITLG drops, allocations may be temporarily adjusted upward to ensure fair compensation and motivation.

All changes will be announced officially and reflected in the next White Paper update.

4. Transparency & Accountability
All transactions and reward allocations are recorded and shared internally within the Coach House for reference.

Coaches are responsible for transparent distribution of the rewards to ensure fairness.

Any misconduct in allocation or favoritism will result in penalties and restructuring.

5. Key Features of the Scheme
Merit-Based Rewards: Only Ambassadors who meet requirements (e.g., reaching Level 100+) share in the redistribution pool.

Sustainability: Designed to ensure continuous motivation while maintaining fair compensation for Global Partners.

Leadership Incentive: Encourages Global Partners to mentor and grow their Ambassadors since their rewards are linked to performance.

Market Flexibility: The halving & adjustment model ensures the ecosystem adapts to token price volatility.

6. Long-Term Impact
Strengthened leadership bonds between Global Partners and Ambassadors.

Greater transparency in the reward system.

Clear pathways for Ambassadors to eventually reach Global Partner status through loyalty, leadership, and performance.

The Global Partners Reward Scheme is not just about tokens‚Äîit is about building trust, loyalty, and long-term sustainability within the InterLink ecosystem.
Reward & Allocation System
House Rules on How to Become an Ambassador & Grow into a Better One

The InterLink Coach House operates under a transparent and merit-based reward system designed to motivate performance, recognize effort, and ensure fair distribution of ITLG.

1. Coaches‚Äô Allocation
Each Coach (e.g., Coach Joel and Coach Luke) receives a fixed allocation of ITLG from the InterLink Labs pool.

Example:

Coach Joel ‚Üí 100,000 ITLG

Coach Luke ‚Üí 100,000 ITLG

This allocation serves as the foundation for reward distribution within the House.

2. House Member Rewards
From each Coach‚Äôs allocation, 20% is reserved for qualified House Members who meet the performance requirements.

Example:

100,000 ITLG allocation ‚Üí 20% = 20,000 ITLG set aside.

If 20 members qualify (reaching level 100+ in the bot system), the 20,000 ITLG is divided equally:

20,000 √∑ 20 = 1,000 ITLG per member.

This ensures that rewards are both fair and performance-driven.

3. Ambassador vs. Ordinary Linker Rewards
Ambassadors ‚Üí Eligible for both direct allocation rewards (from the House pool) and performance-based rewards (from the Ambassador program).

Ordinary Linkers ‚Üí Can qualify for small incentives but do not receive full Ambassador rewards until officially onboarded.

This structure ensures that true Ambassadors are rewarded more heavily while giving Linkers motivation to progress.

4. Transparency & Distribution
All distributions are recorded and tracked via the bot system to avoid disputes.

Coaches commit to sharing transaction history within the Internal House, ensuring transparency among members.

Rewards are distributed within 7 days after cut-off to all qualified recipients.

5. Special Events & Bonuses
During special campaigns or events, additional allocations may be distributed.

These are decided jointly by Coaches and InterLink Labs, ensuring that active contributors receive extra recognition.

In summary:

Coaches receive allocations ‚Üí Reserve 20% for House Members.

Rewards are distributed fairly and transparently via the bot rank system.

Only qualified Ambassadors and active members benefit from the full reward system.
InterLink Ambassadors Reward System
House Rules on How to Become an Ambassador & Grow into a Better One

The Ambassador Monthly Reward System is designed to reward effort, creativity, and community growth. It measures both quantity and quality of contributions while ensuring fairness through strict anti-cheat rules.

This system applies to all official InterLink Ambassadors and is separate from the Global Partner reward scheme.

1. Core Principles
Effort = Reward: Ambassadors earn rewards based on their activity, creativity, and outreach.

Fair Play: Quality is valued over quantity, and cheating is strictly prohibited.

Tier-Based Growth: Rewards scale based on your Ambassador Tier (1, 2, or 3).

2. How It Works
Ambassadors accumulate Content Creation Points (CCP) and Bonus Points (BP) through approved activities.

Content Creation Points (CCP) ‚Üí Awarded for each eligible piece of content submitted.

Bonus Points (BP) ‚Üí Given for high-performing content or special campaigns.

Your Total Points = CCP + BP.
Points are snapshotted weekly (every 7 days) and finalized on the 23rd of each month. Rewards are distributed within the following 7 days.

3. Reward Tiers & Milestones
Each Tier has unique point thresholds and commission bonuses:

Tier 3 Ambassadors

Entry level.

Eligible for basic ITLG rewards upon reaching milestones.

Tier 2 Ambassadors

Mid-level.

Unlock higher ITLG rewards + commission bonus (percentage of monthly referral rewards).

Tier 1 Ambassadors

Top level.

Access to maximum ITLG rewards, commission bonuses, and eligibility for special campaigns.

4. Example Reward Flow
Ambassador creates content across social media.

Each post earns Content Creation Points.

High-performing content (viral reach, strong engagement) earns Bonus Points.

At month-end, total points are tallied.

Rewards = ITLG tokens + Commission Bonus (based on referral earnings).

5. Anti-Cheat & Disqualification Policy üö´
To preserve fairness, the following rules apply:

‚ùå Reposting or stealing content (from Ambassadors or official InterLink accounts)
‚Üí Immediate disqualification or demotion; points reset to 0.

‚ùå Reusing identical content repeatedly across platforms
‚Üí Only the first version is counted; duplicates are rejected.

‚ùå Low-effort videos (static slideshows, no editing, no audio, or stretched content)
‚Üí Counted as an image post or may result in point deduction if repeated.

‚ùå Engagement manipulation (fake likes, bot traffic, buying views, etc.)
‚Üí Zero tolerance ‚Üí permanent ban from tasks + rewards disqualification.

6. Why This Matters
This reward system ensures that authentic creativity, consistent effort, and true loyalty are recognized. Ambassadors who actively build InterLink‚Äôs presence not only earn ITLG rewards but also contribute to the long-term success of the ecosystem.

In conclusion:
By combining content creation, referrals, and consistency, Ambassadors can unlock significant monthly ITLG rewards + commissions while growing their influence in the InterLink community.
üóìÔ∏è
Introducing the InterLink Ambassador Monthly Reward System
House Rules on How to Become an Ambassador & Grow into a Better One

This reward system is designed to track both the quantity and quality of content created by Ambassadors.
Every piece of content you submit will earn a certain number of points (Content Creation Points). High-performing content may receive additional bonus points based on specific criteria (Bonus Points).

Your total points will be accumulated over time, and once you reach certain milestones, you‚Äôll unlock a corresponding amount of ITLG rewards.

In addition, once you reach specific point thresholds based on your Tier, you‚Äôll receive a Commission Bonus in ITLG, calculated from the total referral rewards you earned during the month.

In conclusion, by creating content and referring users, you can earn monthly ITLG rewards plus commissions from your referrals.

üìçPoints are snapshotted every 7 days. The monthly cut-off is on the 23rd, with rewards distributed within the following 7 days.

üö´ Content Rules, Anti-Cheat & Disqualification Policy

üß©Example - For Tier 3 Ambassador
From Day 1 to Day 21, you:

Post 30 posts on X (= 30 x 3 = 90 base points)

All of your post get over 3,000 views  (= 30 x 3 = 90 bonus points)

Post 30 TikTok videos longer than 30 seconds (= 30 x 8 = 240 base points)

All of your TikTok videos get over 3,000 views (= 30 x 8 = 240 bonus points)

‚áí Total base points and bonus points: 660 points

As a Tier 3, your 660 points from Content Creation will be exchanged to 2,500 ITLG

üèÜNew-user Referral Commission (10%)
Each tier will have a specific minimum point threshold from Content Creation, and once that threshold is met, the ambassador will qualify to earn referral commissions for every new user they invite to join the InterLink Real Human Network.

üß©Example - For Tier 3 Ambassador
On Day 21, a snapshot is taken. Since you've passed 500 points from Content Creation, you qualify to unlock the Referral Commission for the month. By the end of the month:

You have 40 F1 referrals = 40 x 500 = 20,000 ITLG earned

You have 50 F2 referrals = 50 x 250 = 12,500 ITLG earned

‚áí Total referral commission = 3,250 (= 10% x 32,500 ITLG)

‚≠êÔ∏èExpanding Ambassador Program Reward (10%)
When you introduce someone to join the Ambassador Program, and they successfully meet the requirements to become an Ambassador, they will start receiving their monthly rewards.

In the same month that they earn rewards, you (as their inviter) will receive an additional 10% based on their reward amount.

Why this reward exists:
It acknowledges your effort in expanding the InterLink network with quality Ambassadors.

It motivates every Ambassador to not only grow individually, but also help others rise and succeed.

The more you inspire new leaders to join, the stronger your team and the community become.

üß©Example
You invite Alex to join as an Ambassador.

Alex meets all conditions and in his first month he earns 1,000 ITLG.

You, as the inviter, receive an additional 100 ITLG (10% of Alex‚Äôs reward).

üí∏ Mentorship Reward
Rules:
Applies only to Tier 2 Ambassadors and above.

Why this reward exists:
This reward is more than just numbers. It is a way to honor the mentors ‚Äî those Tier 1 and Tier 2 leaders who dedicate their time and effort to guide others.

Mentorship & Training: Lower-level Ambassadors receive one-on-one support and careful training from their higher-level leaders.

Recognition of Leadership: The reward acknowledges leaders who show both vision and commitment in developing their teams.

Unity & Growth: It symbolizes the strength of solidarity ‚Äî when leaders invest in their people, the whole community rises together.

üëâ In short, this reward is a token of gratitude for those who not only lead, but also nurture, mentor, and empower others to become leaders themselves.

Reward Structure:
Tier 2 Ambassadors receive 20% of the rewards earned by their Tier 3 down-line.

Tier 1 Ambassadors receive:

20% of the rewards earned by their Tier 2 down-line.

10% of the rewards earned by their Tier 3 down-line.

üß©Example
A Tier 3 Ambassador earns 1,000 ITLG.

Their Tier 2 leader receives commission 200 ITLG (= 20% x 1,000 ITLG).

The Tier 1 leader above them also receives 100 ITLG (= 10% x 1,000 ITLG) from Tier 3‚Äôs rewards and 40 ITLG (= 20% x 200 ITLG) from Tier 2‚Äôs rewards

üí°Difference Between the Two Commissions
Expanding Ambassador Program Reward: You earn 10% of the monthly rewards of any Ambassador you personally invited, once they qualify as an Ambassador.

Mentorship Reward: You earn 20% (Tier 2) or 10% (Tier 1) from the Ambassadors in your team structure who chose you as their leader.

This means if you are both the inviter and the leader, you can receive two rewards from the same person.

üß©Example 1 ‚Äì You are both Inviter & Leader:
You invite me, and I also choose you as my leader.

I earn 10,000 ITLG this month.

You will receive:

Expanding Ambassador Program Reward: 10% √ó 10,000 = 1,000 ITLG

Mentorship Reward: 20% √ó 10,000 = 2,000 ITLG

Total = 3,000 ITLG

üß©Example 2 ‚Äì You are only Inviter:
You invite me, but I choose someone else as my leader.

I earn 10,000 ITLG this month.

You will receive only:

Invite reward: 20% √ó 10,000 = 2,000 ITLG

is for another

‚ô®Ô∏èPenalty for Poor Team Management
If any Tier 3 Ambassador under your management is removed from the program, the leaders above them will face a deduction from their monthly rewards:

Tier 2 Leader: incurs a 5% deduction per removed Tier 3 member.

Tier 1 Leader: incurs a 10% deduction per removed Tier 3 member.

This ensures that leaders at every level actively support, mentor, and manage their teams effectively.

üß©Example Deduction
A Tier 2 Leader earns a total of 5,000 ITLG for the month.

If two Tier 3 Ambassadors in their team are removed during that month, the Tier 2 Leader incurs a 5% penalty per removed member:

5,000 - (5,000 √ó 5% √ó 2) = 4,500 ITLG remaining.

Meanwhile, the Tier 1 Leader above this structure would incur a 10% penalty per removed Tier 3 member from their own total monthly rewards.

By combining creativity, consistency, and loyalty, Ambassadors can secure both short-term ITLG rewards and long-term opportunities for leadership and Global Partner recognition.

Users Insights_ Top AMA Questions
From a few previous AMAs, here are some frequently asked questions that reflect
users‚Äô concerns. Everyone can review them to better understand current user
insights and also use this as a source for creating content.
Tokens & Listing
1. Why does InterLink need two tokens instead of just one?
InterLink uses two tokens because they serve different but complementary
purposes:
‚óè $ITLG ‚Äì Proof of Contribution (internal utility token):
Used inside the ecosystem for gaming, lucky spin, DAO voting, and ITLX
transaction fees. Think of $ITLG as a membership + participation token,
showing that you are an active builder in the Human Network.
‚óè $ITL ‚Äì External, tradable token:
Designed for real-world use such as payments, shopping, hotels, online
services, and exchange. $ITL is what provides InterLink with global reach and
liquidity. As adoption grows, this could drive billions of dollars in daily
transaction volume ‚Äî a rare level of liquidity potential in crypto, which places
early holders of $ITL in a very strong position.
By separating these two roles, InterLink ensures a more sustainable and compliant
ecosystem. $ITLG powers internal growth, while $ITL connects us to the outside
world as the true payment currency. This dual-token design also prepares us for
listings on regulated exchanges (NYSE, NASDAQ), where compliance is critical.
2. What are the steps required for $ITLG verification?
The verification process follows this flow: $ITLG ‚Üí Human Credit Score (HCS) ‚Üí
Verified $ITLG
To maximize your Verified $ITLG, you need to achieve a high Human Credit Score
(HCS). Your HCS is determined by multiple factors, including:
‚óè Active mining level ‚Äì how consistently you mine.
‚óè Mining activity of your referrals ‚Äì your referred users‚Äô mining also
contributes.
‚óè On-chain activities in the InterLink Super Wallet ‚Äì such as swaps, derivatives
trading, stock purchases, and more.
‚óè Community contributions ‚Äì being an Ambassador or actively contributing to
InterLink increases your score.
‚óè Additional trust indicators ‚Äì other objective measures designed to fairly
evaluate each individual‚Äôs credibility.
A higher HCS directly translates into a larger allocation of Verified $ITLG.
3. What is Verified $ITLG?
Verified $ITLG is the process of ensuring that $ITLG belongs to real contributors with
long-term commitment to InterLink.
‚óè Once verified, $ITLG becomes Verified $ITLG ‚Äì the only gateway to convert into
$ITL.
‚óè This process protects the ecosystem from ‚Äúshort-term farming‚Äù (participants
who only collect tokens and leave) and ensures rewards and $ITL go only to
those who truly add value to the community.
Verified $ITLG is the portion of original $ITLG that has been fully verified and officially
moved out of the human node. This means it is no longer affected by the burning
mechanism.
4. How can Verified $ITLG be earned or lost?
‚óè Earned: Verified $ITLG is a pool from $ITLG.
- Basically, users can only earn Verified $ITLG through mining $ITLG.
- Nextly, in order to earn a high amount of Verified $ITLG, one important factor to
earn high Verified $ITLG is HCS (human credit score), users need to have high HCS.
‚óè Lost: Once $ITLG has been verified into Verified $ITLG, it cannot be lost.
However, if before verification a user fails to contribute, leaves the Security
Circle, or only engages short-term, then their unverified $ITLG will not qualify
to become Verified $ITLG.
5. Which token will be listed first: $ITL or $ITLG?
The listing order will depend on InterLink‚Äôs overall strategy and the timing that best
fits market conditions. Both $ITL and $ITLG have distinct roles within the ecosystem,
so the decision on which to prioritize will be made based on what aligns most with
InterLink‚Äôs roadmap at that moment.
At any point in time, whether it‚Äôs $ITLG, Verified $ITLG, or $ITL, each carries its own
unique mission and benefits within the InterLink ecosystem. Together, they are
designed to complement one another and ensure both utility and long-term
sustainability.
6. Why is Verified $ITLG considered the ‚Äúgateway‚Äù to $ITL?
‚óè Short answer: Only Verified $ITLG can be vested/locked to receive $ITL. Not all
$ITLG qualifies; only those verified through contribution and commitment can
be converted. This prevents short-term farming and protects the ecosystem‚Äôs
sustainability.
‚óè Operational details: Once users hold Verified $ITLG, they unlock the ability to
choose vesting/locking plans:
‚óã Short-term vesting ‚Üí immediate liquidity but lower $ITL rewards.
‚óã Long-term vesting/locking ‚Üí stronger commitment, with much higher
$ITL rewards.
This system favors long-term holders and filters out those only seeking
short-term profit.
7. What‚Äôs the difference between $ITLG, Verified $ITLG, and $ITL?
‚óè $ITLG: The internal token, representing proof of contribution. Distributed to
participants through games, activities, and rewards. It is primarily used to
encourage engagement and contribution within the ecosystem.
‚óè Verified $ITLG: $ITLG that has been verified based on contribution, long-term
commitment, and Security Circle participation. Only Verified $ITLG can access
the mechanisms to convert into $ITL through vesting/locking. Verified $ITLG
acts as the filter that ensures valuable rewards go to real, long-term
contributors.
‚óè $ITL: The external, tradable token used for payments and spending outside the
platform. It is designed to achieve global liquidity and can benefit from
mechanisms like burning and buybacks, which increase scarcity and support
its value as the ecosystem grows.
8. How many $ITLG tokens are needed to earn an $ITL token? What is the fixed
ratio?
The only way to obtain $ITL is through Verified $ITLG and the vesting/locking
mechanism. The exact conversion ratios are not fixed in the documents and will be
publicly announced through DAO governance.
Additionally, whether your $ITLG becomes Verified depends on your Human Credit
score, which evaluates your contribution and level of commitment.
9. What is the conversion rate of $ITL and $ITLG?
First, it‚Äôs important to clarify: there is no fixed ‚Äúconversion rate.‚Äù The correct term is
$ITL reward rate.
Here‚Äôs how it works:
1. You mine $ITLG.
2. Based on Human Credit Score (HCS) after verification, you obtain Verified
$ITLG.
3. You can then stake Verified $ITLG to receive $ITL rewards.
Staking options:
‚óè Lock & vest ‚Üí Higher $ITL reward rate. This incentivizes long-term
commitment and supports token price stability.
‚óè No lock ‚Üí You still receive $ITL rewards, but at a lower rate.
Important notes:
‚óè Your $ITLG is never lost. When you stake, it stays intact; you are simply
allocated additional $ITL.
‚óè You have full flexibility: lock all, part, or none of your tokens.
‚óè The reward mechanism is designed to be sustainable, with research drawn
from lessons of other token models.
‚óè The exact $ITL reward rate will be officially announced in the future.
Security Group
10. What role does the Security Group play in the verification process?
Security Group is a different mechanism for mining.
- Instead of individual mining, users expand their human node and earn $ITLG
through being active and referrals.
- Security group or group mining illustrate another trusted and more stable
process of earning $ITLG and Verified $ITLG. Human Nodes can operate in
human-node clusters (group) of 5 Human Nodes, this activates the use of
multi-node consensus. This means, each node verifies the others, forming a
closed-loop trust network. This strengthens the Human Network, raises trust
levels --> higher HCS and higher Verified $ITLG.
‚ÄúThe tighter the relationships you build within your Security Group, the more you
verify, the more members become verified and the more Verified $ITLG you hold;
That's just the mechanism of Human Node.‚Äù
11. Within the Security Group, can users freely choose a group, or must it be
formed through their referral network?
Yes, anyone can. However, the challenge lies in carefully selecting group members.
To maintain high trust and quality, each Security Group must be composed of
reliable members. Therefore, before the official launch of Security Groups, users must
consider their group composition carefully in order to fully leverage the benefits of
Group Mining.
12. How will those who don't have a single referral build their Security Group?
Even if a user has no direct referral, they can still build their Security Group.
- They may join any active group in the community, ensuring that no one is ‚Äúleft
behind‚Äù due to a lack of referrals and that everyone has a chance to get
verified if they remain active.
- Users can also start by inviting close connections such as family members or
friends, which creates a more trusted and accountable Security Circle from the
beginning.
- Alternatively, they can expand by connecting online with other active
community members.
InterLink emphasizes the importance of real, human connections ‚Äî building
Security Circles with genuine relationships strengthens trust, accountability, and
long-term sustainability in the network.
13. If a user‚Äôs Security Group is inactive but the user remains active (e.g., mining 6
times daily), will all accumulated $ITLG still be verified?
‚óè In InterLink‚Äôs mechanism, each user is not limited to just one Security Group,
but can join up to five groups.
‚óè Therefore, if one group becomes inactive, users can still maintain verification
through other groups, as long as they continuously demonstrate their
contributions and activity (e.g., mining daily, attending events, sharing
content).
‚óè As a result, accumulated $ITLG can still be verified if the user remains active
and the other groups in their Security Circle stay engaged.
14. Do Security Group members need to be one of your referrals?
No. Members of your Security Group do not have to be your direct referrals.
‚óè As long as they are active and responsible members, they qualify to build a
trustworthy Security Circle with you.
‚óè This reduces reliance on one‚Äôs personal referral network and encourages
broader community collaboration.
Rewards & Adjustments
15. Why is the token balance decreasing for some users, and what is the reason
behind this adjustment?
The decrease in token balance is mainly due to the burning mechanism - a
deliberate process that reduces supply in order to increase scarcity and protect
long-term holders.
‚óè Payment token vs. Store of value:
‚óã A typical payment token (e.g., USDT) is used only for transactions. Its
value remains stable because there is no scarcity effect.
‚óã A store of value token not only functions as a payment medium but also
holds or even appreciates in value thanks to mechanisms such as
burning, which reduce supply.
‚óè Real-world example: After Ethereum‚Äôs EIP-1559 upgrade, every transaction
began burning a small portion of ETH. As a result, supply decreased while
demand stayed strong ‚Üí ETH became more scarce, held value better, and in
many cases, appreciated in price.
‚óè Application to InterLink:
‚óã $ITL isn‚Äôt designed to be just a payment token.
‚óã Through regular burning, the total supply of $ITL decreases over time.
‚óã As user adoption grows and demand rises, the combination of lower
supply and higher demand makes $ITL more valuable.
In short: Burning transforms $ITL from a simple payment token into a long-term
store of value for holders, while also ensuring fairness and sustainability in
tokenomics. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs essential for you to stay active - inactivity can cause your
tokens to be burned.
16. Are the $ITLG tokens I receive in games or bonuses verified tokens?
No, the $ITLG you receive from games, activities, or bonuses are not immediately
Verified $ITLG.
‚óè To become Verified $ITLG, these tokens must pass through the verification
process, which evaluates your contributions and commitment.
‚óè This is measured using your Human Credit Score, which tracks activities such
as gaming, participation, referrals, content creation, and leadership
contributions.
‚óè Only after your Human Credit Score and Security Circle activity meet the
requirements will your $ITLG be converted into Verified $ITLG.
In short: Earning $ITLG through games or bonuses is only the first step ‚Äî what truly
matters is maintaining contribution and commitment so those tokens can be
verified.
No. If one of your referrals becomes inactive, the referral rewards you previously
17. Can I get back the referral rewards that were taken from me if an inactive
referral decided to be active again?
No - referral rewards that have already been burned will not be restored. Once
burned, those $ITLG are permanently removed from circulation.
Example:
‚óè When you invite a direct referral, you receive 500 $ITLG as a reward.
‚óè If that referral becomes inactive and is burned to 0, you will lose the 500 $ITLG
you had earned from them. That amount will never be returned.
‚óè However, this person is still considered your referral. Your HHP (Human Help
Points) is what reflects referral activity:
‚óã When they go inactive, your HHP decreases.
‚óã If they later become active again, your HHP will return to normal.
In short: Past rewards in $ITLG are not restored, but reactivation of your referral will
help you regain HHP and improve your future earning potential.
